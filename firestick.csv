Everything is great but i bought it for 3999/- and after 2 days price was 3199/- which hurts me alot 800/- rs loss. Being a prime customer i am very unhappy with the massive price drop.
"I am useing Sony bx32 modal tv(2012) it have 2 HDMI Port . But fire tv stick is not supporting to my tv, not working properly & getting display issues. so don't buy for Sony TV's"
"Product works well upto 1year... Then u need to buy new one only... No choice because.... I bought this product for Rs. 2799 in offer after a year my remote stopped working, if you put new battery it will dry in 3 days itself.. so I want to buy new remote....  New remote only cost Rs. 2000... It's a cheating .... Other brand like mi gives cheaper remote..."
"There is no customer support or details available on which TVs it is not compatible with. And guess what it is not returnable as well, got my 4000 bucks wasted. I bought this after watching so many positive reviews but feel so sad now about this"
In the product description it says 'Made in India' but on the package box it says that it is from China .This is very misleading

¬†The system ui interface  totally changed,Grey Icon(missing icon) on side loaded apps""See All"" tab MissingUpdate didn't fix anything...I thought I've got a defective product tried replacingBut Amazon didn't respondI've used my friend's fire stick and I know his firestick doesn't have these issues almost used it for a month and didn't face any problem hence I proceeded to buy one for myself but I'm disappointed got a defective product or the softwareMore disappointing thing is I can't even Replace it wow."
"It is a really good streaming device . Apps work perfectly fine . You can sideload 3rd party app easily . Remote is fine , voice control is perfect , installation is simple , streaming quality is great.BUT WHY 1 STAR??you cannot change the volume in your Bluetooth headset or airpods which don't have its own volume control . Well i usually watch movies at night while others are sleeping so I prefer using Bluetooth headsets . Whenever I pair it with firestick It always plays at 100 percent and makes my eardrum tear and made me switch off tvThis is a basic function which can be included in a firmware upgrade , but as of 30th June , there is no update regarding this .So yes if this is important for you , u choose other streaming device .Btw i fall in love with their remoteüòç"
I purchased the product in May 2021. It stopped functioning within one month. I requested for an replacement. The customer service execute informed me to buy another Fire Stick and will replace the one one once I purchased a new one. It is more than a week I bought a new fire stick and also informed the CC. Unfortunately there is no feedback from them. The old product was not replaced. Is it a punishment for me to buy your product and I have to pay for a faulty product. Please expedite.
"I was forced to buy Firestick 3rd generation after my Amazon Firestick First Generation stopped working. It was working fine till afternoon and after showing Software update in progress, it got stuck and never worked.I called up the Executive and after trying everything was asked to take it to nearby center. As the center is quite far, I didn't go, but ordered the third generation instead.I wrote to Amazon, if they are selling the product, then they should also provide after sales service. They can always charge. No issues.The person should visit home to rectify the problem. Trust me, there have been instances when some Electronics company sent a technician to home, though the equipment was worth only 2000 Rs.And here we are talking about an equipment costing Rs.4000 to Rs. 6000.How can an equipment stop working while updating software, still I can't get it. Is that deliberate so that Customer buys the new version?Not to say, I regret buying the third generation Firestick. It's a great experience. Great sound. It's a marvel. Amazon always had been my first Choice.The only letdown was equipment stopped working during update. Never heard of. Amazon should regard loyalty.Almost Each day, can you believe it, we order something from Amazon. Please check records."
"I ordered a fire tv stick 3rd gen 2021 during the recent Prime Fest of 26th & 27th July 2021. At the time of ordering the product detail very categorically said that there is a One Year free subscription to Sony Liv, ZEE5 & Voot bundled along with the product. This was in the description section of the product that I ordered, hitch was very promptly delivered to me. Now when I enquired with Amazon helpline about how to activate the free subscription, the customer support denied any offer like this & now I am supposed to pay separately for these subscriptions. How I wish I had taken a screen shot of this & kept with me. At least would have saved myself from the misery of being denied of what was promised to begin with. I don‚Äôt know how that promotion appeared there, could have been a technical glitch on the part of Amazon but I am sure I bought this with the subscription which is now denied. It a shame for Amazon to get so petty & completely disown the responsibility to fulfil their offer. I just feel cheated to the core."
1)While setting up device keeps getting turned off every 2 minutes.2)No sound while playing anythingAfter few hours it everything got okDevice did not switch off and sound was back.Now after 3 days same problemDevice is switching off every 2 minutes and no sound.Is there some software issue with the device or device is faulty?
"I was using LG 4K TV with WebOs 3 and i dont have recent streaming apps as it not available in my smart TVI have ordered HD Firestick 2021.My TV Supports HDR ...I would have ordered 4K but for me itseems costly..Pro:Super UIFast SettingsHDR !!Dolby Digital Plus ,Dolby audio as my TV supports only this.Connected with Yamaha AV receiver and i could able to get DD+ 7.1 from Dolby Atmos Content in amazon Prime.Sound Quality is awesome...Picture quality was fabulous as my TV supports HDR and ultra deep colour it detects and restarts tv to enable in that HDMI port...The moment i have turned on it install latest Fire Stick SWCons:Not for Device.I have logged in with my amazon account in FireTV.I could not get install the Disney+Hotstar its shows app is not availableThen i have called customer care and they helped to set my country to IN in account as i used same account in Germany(.de) as wellAfter that all india streaming apps are visibkle (voot,Hotstar+disney,SunNxt,...etc)Overall happy with purschase will update after few days of usuage!!!"
Nothing gets displayed after fire stick logo. Blank screen came. Never expected this outcome.
Totally disappointed. Wastage of money. Not required for smart Android TV. Might be for small normal TV. Price is too high. Better quality products with latest specifications are available in the market at very less price. Not satisfied and not recommend to buy.
The most important thing on which amazon in betraying us is that it doesn't supports voice search. For example alexa button is there but it can only play things on amazon prime video. If u open zee 5 or youtube you will not get the mic button to search and will have to press the assistant button which will take you somewhere else and will not search for things we want. It UI is excellent but this voice search is the main issue. Thats why you should be going for mi stick.
"Once the fire TV stick is on, the colour logo is loaded half and then disappeared. After then no response in tv only black screen display."
Such a waste product..bought it to make my tv smart..but it keeps restarting itself and is of no use..i have been a regular customer of Amazon..but after this deception ..i think they are not worth your money..Amazon please replace my fire stick
"Update: After using for 10 days of usageDevice is up to date yet the wifi capturing frequency is pathetic and it keeps losing the connection. I spent half of my time fixing the connection issue and it ruins the user experience.Returning it. Don't go for it. Highly recommended.Took 4 hours to watch 2 hours movie. Have turned off auto updates, changed settings still it takes forever to load though the internet speed is 35 Mbps."
Quality of the product and packaging is really recommendable. I brought it at a great price of 2799. The stick supports maximum 1080p videos (I tried with my 32inch led). Sound is stereotype. Not tested whether it is dolby digital or not. It supports both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz of internet. Remote is quite handy. Alexa voice responses are recommendable. Interface is attractive and fast. Pairing of remote with the tv is done automatically on first setup and even one can set other consoles by going to add remote option which is available in the fire stick. Remote provided is RF type. One thing I disliked is the pressing of remote buttons. It should be soft press rather than hard press.I would personally suggest to go for it if anyone wish to buy.Thanks for the deal Amazon
"My Sony bravia non-smart tv has in-built Prime and Netflix app and few others but no Disney Hotstar. So I decided to buy this Firestick and ended up with out of the box experience! The picture, audio and streaming clarity this gave was far far better than my tv in-built apps!!!Plugged it in directly to my JBL soundbar which has HDMI-in passthrough rather than connecting to TV which gave crystal clear sound. Have to be patient for the initial setup. After that just relax and binge!! Terrific purchase!! Thank you Amazon for the offer pricing too!"
"During Prime day sale, 3rd Gen Stick supposed to come with Sony LIV, Zee5 and Voot Subscription as shown while booking the item. But it is not working. Please do the needful"
"Received a defective piece,which would not connect to wifi and even a brief connection happens,failing again and again,have checked with different networks & tried on alternate HDMI ports,but problem persisted"
"Order on 4th april, deliveey was expecting 24th april, but received on 1st may 2021, after i open the packet, item an missing.. so irresponsible service."
"Used for 30  daysRemote response time seem to be increasing.1.5v amazon basics cells have died in just 3 weeks.New batteries gone in 1 week, its draining battery , remote shows low battery everytime. It refuses to respond, stops working intermittently.Customer care guys have only one solution to reatart fire tv, reboot, reset remote and any of these didn't work.Seems to be a hardware issue. I need a replacement."

¬†After 3 months of purchase it stopped working.Firetv just stuck to logo.Tried every solution which was available at internet.Then i talked to customer service they are saying it is under warranty but they can't replace it directly so the we have to buy it again giving 3999 which i bought at rps 2199 .Then after delivery they will refund you. Such a  scam. Didn't expect this kind of things from amazon. I have warranty for this product why you just can't replace it? Why do i have to purchaae again and waste extraa 2k money???"
"I bought it today.Power and volume control of the firestick remote not working.I had called the customer care and after one and a half hour of trying different trouble shooting methods, I was told that my TV is not compatible..if that was the case, there was no need to try all methods right !!What kind of LCD Tv is compatible is not mentioned in the product information.I would have bought the lesser priced 2nd generation model in that case.Very disappointing.Amazon needs to look into this .."
"The device if connected with Wifi and detect internet, works amazingly. But the challenge I faced is that getting it started when I first connected it was a 2 hour ordeal. The device connected to my wifi but was saying 'No internet'. I have to reset the wire stick multiple time which did not work. Then I had do factory reset some 2-3 time, after which finally the 'No internet' error disappeared. After that the device worked fine for a month.After than again the Wifi connected but 'no internet' issue started. I have did a factory reset now, but the issue still persist. At the time of posting the this review the issue was not fixed. I hope it get fixed"
Mi Tv Box 4k at 3500 is still a better deal compared to this it's older than this but it's always been faster than my firesticks in terms of ui navigation.This firestick is not bad it does what it's supposed to do has a new menu system. All major streaming services work but I always feel that there is a slight lag on the user interface Amazon just bloats the home page with so many options I just wish I could just turn off all thr suggestions and that would speed up the ui. I just want to see my apps on the home screen not all the suggestions which is as is slowing down the ui and at the same time overflowing my home page with junk suggestions.
"i bought this product and since yesterday its started creating problem. When i connect it to my tv, the tv simply restart again and again. i called sony Tv technician and  he checked and said tv is fine but this firestick is faulty which is creating thia problem. kindly refund the amount and take back your faulty product."
"https://in.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00008QmKIPSA3/fail-to-connect-to-amazoncomPosted issue detail at forum too.WIFI connection successful. But fails to connect to amazon.com.And hence fire tv update fails.Tried plugin, out of power cord of fire stick, router etc, nothing worked.Tried factory reset( back key + right side of navigation circle) : factory reset doesn't occur.note: My WIFI connection is good. My LG TV is working fine and has prime video working fine.This is the first time am trying fire stick on my LG TV.if no response from customer care, will return product."
I am giving this review again after using fire tv stick for the last 1 month. Previously I gave 4 star rating because volume and power buttons were not working due to videocon tv compatibility. But after some days Mr. Naresh(Technician team) called me and forwarded a mail to me for again remote setup and update. So I followed all steps as I received on mail and I am so happy to share my review again that now my fire tv stick is updated and all buttons are working finely. I m very thankful to Amazon for providing super best service and also to Mr. Naresh.. Product is really awesome. Go for it blindly‚úå‚úå
"Product did not worked properly. Live tv tab was not showing any Channel. Returned without any hassle , thumbs up to amazon team for timely delivery n tension free returns!!"
"This device is something that I now regret not having bought earlier. Its super easy to use, more so with its voice control feature, which makes tuning into your favourite channel/music/video a breeze. I am using it with my old Sony Led TV (bought in 2011) which does not have internet or bluetooth. The experience is simply amazing. A highly recommended product even for new-age smart TVs because it makes toggling between different OTT providers super easy and fun. The only problem that I am having is connecting the remote to my TV's volume/power controls.Mine is a 3rd Gen, 2021 Firetv and I got it during a flash sale for a good discount @2699/-Tip: Watchout for any sales and jump on the opportunity."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Tried multiple ways to sort out the issue but it's not supporting at allIt will be nice if you provide the solution or help to use the volume controls using the firestick remote"
"First I bought fire tv lite stick which worked with SONY LED Tv 2012 model .But felt lite tv stick remote was cumbersome has it did not have volume,power and direct app buttons. Needed multiple remotes for smooth operation. So I went for 3rd generation fire tv stick which had all the buttons on single remote. But 3rd generation stick could not be paired with SONY TV after multiple attempts, changing batteries and lot of trouble shooting. Wish Amazon mentioned the names of Tvs with which this fire tv stick is compatible, it would have saved time and effort.So returned the stick and asked for refund."
"Worked well out of the box, but performance markedly deteriorated within 3 months. After 6 months, was slow, laggy, unresponsive, and had to press buttons multiple times to recognize input. Drains batteries much more rapidly than other remotes, I need to replace the battery once a week now, and even then it doesn't work. Without doubt the worst, most overpriced purchase I have ever made on Amazon. Please don't be fooled by the positive reviews, most of these are people who are excited about the new product but haven't yet used it for a year."

¬†When I read reviews, I was confused to buy this product. But I have decided to take risk and purchased it. When I received this item this afternoon, I was totally upset in my mind whether I can make it ready or not. But surprisingly it was so simple to setup and viewing all channels including jio tv. I personally recommend to everyone, it‚Äôs amazingly simple to setup and viewing all channels without any hassles. Wonderful product. Recommended for everyone. Thanks Amazon for such a wonderful product üòÑ"
"The quality of remote is really worst not sure whether its bcos of made in India. The touch and feel of remote shows the quality, since i have used 2 generation of firestick devices. Its not like previous one. And the UI is different from 2nd generation. And totally i don't like it. The UI looks like smart tv."
"I have a Micromax led around 7 years old and I was about to sell and buy a smart one, but this device made my unsmart LED a very Smart oneEasy to use, the picture quality is awesome and Alexa is very much helpfulApps are easily downloadable and games for the kids are thereThe only setback is the volume button is not on the remote that we can manage.overall 10 on 10 device."
"Overall this is a great product.However i will give 1 star for the atmos feature. As its providing atmos signal only on netflix and NOT on prime video, hotstar or apple tv appWhen i contacted amazon customer service the guy udhay searched for answers half an hour and ultimately suggested to try factory reset. My god. The device arrived yesterday in factory settings only and its not even 24 since setup. So how would factory reset help??Amazon guys font seem to have any clue about atmos"

¬†Hello Amazon, if anyone has had this problem and has found a solution, please share it with me."
The first stick had issues with remote pairing and was stuck at setup stage. Got the replacement and the same issue again. Remote is not pairing. Now seeing so many commentsand understand that the latest manufacturing has some issue. Useless... now returning it.
"The voice search is bad ,while searching it only gives results realted to Amazon prime video contents and not any other platform even, but when we enter a app and do the voice search it works fine.While connecting a Bluetooth headphone it's volume can't be controlled by the fire tv remote and will be set to maximum volume so can only be changed if the headphone itself has volume control feature.The appstore is that from Amazon itself.And there is limited apps on the Amazon appstore.And also there is no 5.1 sound support even though it does support Dolby digital and digital Plus.The remote is functional and good.For watching live tv except for 2 or 3 free apps paid subscription is required.Edit:- after about 4 to5 months the power adaptor got damaged but  got a new one  under warrenty."
"Product is awesome. But disappointed with cost.  When i ordered this on 14th june 21, i paid 3999 rs. I wanted another 1 so tried ordering it again saw the price slashed to 3199 rs. Felt looted types. Its not 800rs which are shortcoming, but people boast saying they got it for lesser price which hurts ur ego.Else this is a fantastic product."
"Simply an amazing product from Amazon. It's converted my 8 years old LED tv to smart tv with Ultra HD picture quality. You just need a broadband connection with WiFi that's enough it will run live TV's, shows, entertainment everything. Thank you Amzon for promt delivery. Got the product in Rs 2799 as special discount"
"This is the best option to make your hdmi capable tv to smart tv.But after 7days at 18th October 2021, after I start fire tv stick it's home screen goes black. I tried all method like deregistration, restart, factory reset etc but problem still persist.At last 3rd factory reset black screen problem is fixed. Please Amazon fix it by os update.So this problem can't happen again. So this product may not be long lasting.Black home screen problem persist due to slow wifi connection or low ram/cache memory, so don't download too much app. You should save 3gb space to run fire stick normal."
"No matter how many hours you try. The remote simply refused to pair. Watched many videos, read articles and tried in all possible ways, still the result was same. it turned out to be a waste of money."
"This review is for the 2021 version. Got it for ‚Çπ2400 in prime sale. Following is the summary:1. Easy to setup, takes time though (especially for the update(s)).2. Runs on fire OS that is a fork of the Android operating system, so the appstore might not have everything, but you can sideload apps using the debug option (although, not recommended).3. Screencast worked with OnePlus and Mi phones.4. Voice search works on YouTube and other apps, but using mobile to search through on screen keyboard was easier.5. Bluetooth devices work, you can even add game controllers.6. Streaming quality is great even on 1080p, I thought koryo TV's are bad, but this device delivered a great experience.7. Power button and volume buttons are mapped to the TV, the TV remote is useless if you are using Fire Stick, so for volume control and power, you will use this device, and you can tuck away the TV remote for good."
All that was expected - Turned my non-smart tv into an android one. As long as your TV has an HDMI port and supports at least 720p (HD ready) it should work. Otherwise additional gadget may be required.Setup was tricky though. I can understand why some people gave up and returned the product. Here's an advice:1. At first prompt choose eng US as language.2. After filling account details it shows an OTP to register the device. You'll expect an email or a notification in amazon app to provide the OTP. But the email/notification never arrives. This is the frustrating part.3. Go to amazon.com/tv (the instruction appears on screen) from your PC or phone browser to provide the OTP. That's it.4. My firestick kept restarting (rebooting) throughout the setup process and I had to re-start the task many times. I thought mine was a faulty stick. Then I made sure the HDMI connection and power connection were firmly secured (tightened). That solved the problem.
1) cost in India and cost in USA too much  difference2) Hardware wise we need 2gb ram  and 16gb storage as minimum.3) inability to control Bluetooth volume from  fire stick is a deal breaker4) Inability to decode and provide Dolby  atmos via Bluetooth or HDMI is a Real deal  breaker. Should have opted for Nokia  streamer where in it is available.  My Laptop can do headphone Dolby Atmos  by buying the license from Microsoft store.5) Unable to switch off Samsung Dce32  signage display via power button on the  fire stick remote6) unable to select 1080 60hz or 30 hz video  on YouTube if it‚Äôs available when viewing  same video on laptop.
product description saying 2021 model.. but the firetv telling its 2020 version. zebronics 9800 DWS PRO DOLBY ATMOS SOUND BAR showing DOLBY SURROUND when playing selected Dolby atmos movies (eg: CARNIVAL RAW) from prime ( we can't see a single atmos label in any title). its a fake business telling this stick supports Dolby atmos- DOLBY DIGITAL PLUS is maximum available audio but showing Dolby surround in sound bar. Airtel xtream box doing great job than this.
"Works Great. No issues. The menu navigation is butter smooth. Initially had issue with upgrades during installation. The device simply keeps restarting. However I did a factory reset and tried again. And this time it downloaded and installed the upgrades and went to the setup screen without any problems. Using it on a Epson projector setup with the help of a hdmi splitter. Fire Stick has Bluetooth, so audio is connected to Sony 5.1 speakers Using Bluetooth. Finally true home theater experience."
Does not works on every tv. My sony Bravia had hdmi port then also fire tv stick was not working anyone who has sony Bravia don't buy this
"Overall a good uswful device but the setup is slow, the remote is extremely unfriendly and without numbers and alphabets typing is a pain. Better to use the mobile remote app of fire tv to navigate.And something not right with hotstar as it gets hidden everytime on the screen.Definitely they need to work on the UI and maybe UX. Pretty average product I'd say with a great marketing and space to be in as a first mover."

¬†I was using Amazon Fire TV Stick 2nd generation. I was finding difficulties to open apps like Zee5, Sonyliv. It's response was slower and many times it gets crashed. So I wanted to try this new 3rd generation Amazon Fire TV Stick. I got in a deal at about Rs. 2000. I was reluctant to purchase it but after using it I was satisfied. It's fast as compared to last 2nd generation AFT Stick. Response to Alexa is also better.Only one problem what I am facing is that there is audio output problem when I use zoom (side loaded and updated). That was when I was using 2nd generation AFT Stick."
"It works perfectly with yamaha home theatre. Watching movies is so much fun now. We had a Chromecast before this. And I must tell that this device is way ahead of Chromecast. No more fiddling with the phone to watch. Just one remote controls even my HTR.Plus the voice functionality is pretty intuitive. Even my 5 yr old uses it to watch rhymes. Sigh!!!There are still some niggles though. Searching for content within an app is tough. Eg. Search for a song in Spotify and it would start playing in Amazon Music. Is that by design? Well, everything else works fine.Also, you need to keep the remote coddled. It costs 2000 bucks to replace and that remote is the lifeline of this device."
"The Product is good but don't buy if you have fire stick 3rd generation no difference in processor same 1.7 GHz processor just the major difference is in remote which have shortcut keys for Netflix and prime video, if you are getting firestick 2020 from retail market buy it don't waste money on this 2021 stick."
"This is my 2nd firestick, 1st one I bought on 2019 prime day for 2199. I got this for same price. First device worked fine till 1yr.After that there was problem with sound, sometime sound goes off and doesn't come back. After some day, remote started giving problem. Frequent disconnect battery drainage etc.I had to replace the old one. You can only buy all Amazon exclusive products on prime day as the price goes lower than expected.New device has new interface, faster screen load, and improved remote. Since far all my existing problem are not seen in new one. Hope this one goes till 2023 so that I can buy 4th gen on prime day, ha ha.."
This is my first Fire TV Stick. Got it at a great price and perfect time at Amazon sale. This is my review after 15 days of use.Installation and initial setup was very simple and connected to my BSNL fibre broadband wifi in a jiffy. It also works well with mobile hotspot. But to enjoy streaming to the fullest better to have fibre broadband.The new UI is absolutely fantastic with smooth and fluid interface. Browsing experience is fantastic too.All major apps are available in app store. Streaming is top class without any lag or buffer with outstanding picture quality. Switching between apps is also lag-free.Alexa remote is just superb with perfect voice recognition on my first ever attempt.Simply go for it.
"What I love:1. Voice search within apps like youtube, primevideo, hotstat etc..2. Voice search is very fast. I have another LG tv which has web os and it's very slow in searching.3. Stream quality is good4. Lots of apps and games5. Has Inbuilt Bluetooth. Connects to multiple bluetooth devices. And it also has good range and no lag. It even has the option to sync audio and video if you notice any lag. üíú6. Firestivk Remote can be used to control TV power and volume.What I don't like:Takes long to boot"
"My first buy FireStickWas skeptical to go for the older Lite version or the newer 2021 one since the price difference was significantWent for thisGot it delivered very late probably due to non availabilityWorks smoothEasy to set upBest part is they provide extension HDMI.Resolution is only 1080p so I guess a max 42inch TV I guess.UI is smooth.Remote is handy and works really wellA very good device for older TV who are not interested to buy a new one just for the sake of smart featuresI would recommend this productBut at 3999‚Çπ, it is not cheap as well"
"I have been looking for a good solution to steam various OTT platforms for a while. This one solves the problem perfectly.Apart fro usuals - streaming apps, games, platform support, I really like bluetooth connectivity now I can watch movies / shows without disturbing others around me.I dunno why I didn't go for it earlier."
"It supports all major streaming services includingAmazon primeDisney hotstar+NetflixZee5Sony LivMX player TVand the most wanted YouTubeit also has built inScreen mirroringMenuAlexa supportGo for it, also during great Indian festival I got it at ‚Çπ2199 (gen 3 2021)"
"I never imagined a product this nice and perfect. I mean, there is hardly any thing which is wrong or faulty.1. Works with any brand of LED TV as long as it has an HDMI port. Now even not so smart TV can be a smart Tv. If you have an old non smart TV, for a small expense, you can enjoy smart tv experience.2. Has bluetooth as well with which you can connect your headphones so that you can enjoy late night shows without disturbing sleep of person sleeping next to you.3. The Prime day sale gave this at a fabulous price.4. Though it works better on a high speed internet connection it still works satisfactorily on a mobile hotspot. With a 2 gb data, you can easily enjoy a full movie. It will be a bit lesser if you skip and fast forward the songs.5. It even plays Youtube. Keeping kids entertained was never so easy.6. One wish.. the case which is sold separately for 400 Rs should be a part of entire kit.Full Value for money ."
"This can to be used directly with TV normally. No issues work smoothly and video clarity. Audio is where it shines. If you have a Dolby or Atmos audio system this one nails with audio. In display and audio settings we have auto volume level and dialogue enhance. Normal pcm also sounding great. Dolby sounds awesome. If your audio system is HDMI arc and connected to tv, then this one firetv remote will control tv home theater and fire stick. For tv on off and volume control it uses infrared. Its a very intelligent way of implementation."
The stick is not compatible with my Kodak Smart TV and popular application like Jio TV is also not installable in this third generation model. So highly dissatisfied. The issues to be addressed immediately otherwise the confidence of customers on this well known product of Amazo will be get effected adversely
"Super product, easy to setup, just plug and play, it takes you through simple configuration steps, only glitch is at sound configuration, you need to identify the correct (your) TV IR sound profile in advance settings, that's it you can start watching the contents on apps/channels through fire sticks.Purchased on sale time, over that seller provided discount coupon worth 300 rupees , 10% bank discount and Amazon privided special discount during sale üï∫üíÉProsBuild quality is excellent.Easy to configure.Remote having more functionality, like sound buttons, switch on/off tv , extra buttons for dedicated apps like Prime vedio, Netflix, amazon music and apps buttonConsOnce found will update the review"
"First things first!!!!! The no-1 TV Stick in Indian Market...This 3rd Generation Fire TV stick has a superb build quality. The remote has a premium look & feels great in hand. The set-up with TV is just seamless.Now coming to the streaming quality. It is wow wow wow. (with good net /wifi). You need to install the apps you want to watch, like Hotstar, Zee5, Voot, Disney+, Hoichoi, etc, etc., etc. The Overall experience with these apps is really cool. The newly introduced Live section seamlessly connect to LIVE channels via the installed apps."
"1: Take time to start.2: Not buttery smooth interface.3: In 2021 still they are giving Micro-USB, it should be Type-C.4: Hang most of the time. (I have only 4 app, Netflix, Prime, YouTube, Hotstar)"
"This is my second Fire Stick and I am regretting the purchase. Had a poor experience with the first one as well.I bought the 1st gen Stick a few years ago - which lasted a couple of years and then it developed a personality. It would connect to wifi when it wanted and disconnected whenever it felt like it. Some days it would refuse to recognize the router (I have fiber FTH). And one fine day it stopped working completely.I bought the latest (2021) version of the First Stick to give it another try. On the first day, within 15 minutes of use, I started getting warnings from it - messages on the TV screen saying it was getting overheated (it is used in a room with an AC always on - with an ambient temperature at 25C or lower). I suspect this too will die in a few weeks of use.Sometimes you get what you pay for. Seems to be made of ultra cheap components. So no surprise that its performance is garbage. Avoid.IMHO, Roku is a far better value for money (my Roku from a decade ago is still working fine). You can play all the apps on it, just like the Fire Stick. But it is rock solid and you will be happy with it."
This is my second purchase after previous one stopped working all of a sudden immediately after warranty ended. Upon calling I was asked to get repair from 3rd party for ‚Çπ1500/=.There was prime day offer and I got the new 3rd Gen stick for ‚Çπ2100/= and I said money well spent. I could not have been wrong. The new one is already giving trouble within 2 months of purchase. Yet to contact Amazon but quality is pathetic.I have old WDTV Live Media Player that's running since 2014 without any issues. Why can't Amazon build quality products?Please avoid buying.NOT RECOMMENDED.
"Helps to make your semi -smart TV to a smart Tv by adding a lot of apps and Alexa. I had been using the Fire TV 2020 model as part of Tata Sky Binge - first month free and then Rs.249 a month added to your Tata Sky DTH recharge. And to watch Netflix, Amazon, Zee5, Hotstar, etc. you pay separately ranging from Rs.499 a year to the same a month. Last month, I ditched Tata Sky Binge and bought the new Fire TV stick 2021 at Rs.3999 and the difference is that I own this. Functionally, there‚Äôs not any difference between the new and the old barring dedicated buttons fir Netflix and YouTube on the remote. Anyway, Fire TV stick is useless without subscription to the Apps mentioned earlier. The new TVs May not require this though. I bought a new LG Oled TV which comes with an additional Magic Remote which does all the stuff done by Fire TV stick + it acts like a computer mouse and better in selecting the alphabets when you need to type in your log in id for any app ( can log in using the same app on phone too without this trouble). I am using the Fire TV stick on the Sony Bravia bought in 2015 which is somewhat smart and Fire TV stick brings it at par with the new LG TV, well almostüòÄ"
"I am using Firestick from 2017 when 1st Gen was released in India, recently it stopped working so I thought of buying 3rd Gen. My old device was much better than this, both built quality of remote as well as steam quality was awesome in 1st Gen.Pros of 3rd Gen:1. Good option to sync power and volume of TV2. Netflix and Prime buttons, not very useful but good to have3. Navigation and app speed is goodCons:1. Volume is worst, even if you keep the volume at 60% still not clearly audible, I am really disappointed on this point2. No dolby effect, may be I need to get home theater system to experience the dolby, but without that sound quality is bad3. Remote control was very flimsy and easley breakable if it fell down. Back cover is not fitting properly4. Streaming quality is not good, even in full HD mode, media quality is bit blurryAll the above points are comparing with my old firestick"
"After a month stop working..tried to contact supplier but supplier not giving support and asking to contact Amazon, on Amazon their is no option to get warranty support. dear seller kindly provide us required support to get the issue resolve.@amazon- please help."
"When I had placed the order for the fire stick during the prime day sale, they had displayed that enjoy zee5, sonyliv & voot  for 1 year bundled with the firestick but now when I tried I am getting error saying this offer is not for this device. First when I called Amazon customer care, they told me a procedure to login.When it still didn't happen, now customer care says that this offer not applicable for ur device. Then y were they displaying that subscription for those 3 are free along with the firestick?? Amazon has to sort out this issue at the earliest. Really disappointed!!"
"There is a serious problem with the product. I have got it replaced it earlier also. The problem persists.Every time the powe gets off, even for a few seconds, on resuming of the power, the Fire Tv Stick does not recognise the IP address and you have to disconnect it and start again. A big manufacturing problem.- Viney Mitral"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†It's good but it doesn't have sony sports channels and zee5 channels on the homepage. Why?"
Worst built quality of remote. It's dead in 5 days. Tried all the recommended methods to reset and nothing worked. For INR 4000 you sell such a cheap quality product which lasts not even a week. Seriously??? Totally disappointed.
"For those having problems with some buttons not working READ THIS :When i recieved my firestick it was superb. Everything was working great. But after few days of usage or let‚Äôs say1-2 weeks , the Volume button , Power button & Mute button stopped working. I was soo disappointed.The streaming and everything else worked fine. Soo i just continued using it cz the exchange process is very tedious.After few months it was time to change the batteries (had been using the batteries provided with the kit till now).And Viola ! Once i put in the new batteries, the remote was working absolutely fine once again. Even the buttons that Had stopped working were absolutely fine.Therefore, long story short - just replace the batteries if few  buttons on your remote stop working."
"not worth to upgrade, 3rd gen stick is better perform application switching but not seen much difference specially Sony liv & Zee5 compare to 2ndgen stick  , Amazon team should thing about to add more RAM to handle applications instead of adding application specific dedicate buttons on remote. Still I am a FAN of Amazon Fire TV is not comparable with any other steaming device it best streaming device available in market I am using it since 2017."
"The device looks new and of good quality but it is simply not setting up. As soon as it starts, it gets stuck on ""Searching for remote"" screen. The remote is not pairing with the firestick at all. I have tried every solution; changing batteries even though the product is brand new, factory resetting the remote, fire tv app, and all other ways available online. Nothing seems to work. Since remote is not pairing up with the device, it is also not proceeding further. I have no menu, no options left. I have spent a whole day trying to set it up. I am not going to waste anymore time because this is a device which is supposed to have a simple setup with most of the functions done automatically. There is no replacement option available for it. I am just going to return this firestick and try other products available in the market."
"Streaming quality is goodTaking 1 star out for everytime when i switch on its says check network settings I already used chrome cast with same connection it won't happened like thatAnd my Tv is VU ... syncing remote is a big issue , i spent almost 2 ,3 hrs to get the volume buttons to get synced ..you have to go advance settings and check the IR profiles which one will suit your TV ..after lot of patience my tv synced with 12th profile"
"This is an amazing product. I am using it with just a monitor and works well. The controls are intuitive. Alexa is an excellent addition. My only gripe would be the storage capacity, if they included a memory card slot to expand the firstick's memory this would have been golden.Update after a year of using:It stopped working after using it for a year. They say it had a software issue. Surprised that Amazon's flagship product is not as good. There are constant disconnects. I purchased a MI stick at the same time and I haven't faced any issues with the MI stick. The MI stick is still functioning while my Amazon stick has to be thrown in the garbage bin because it is useless."
"I have an older 4k tv which doesn't support dolby atmos,  but a new atmos compatible soundbar. Was struggling to getting atmos source till i came across this newer model of firestick that supports atmos content on netflix too. Even the 4k stick doesnt. I do miss the 4k stream but full hd hdr with dolby atmos is good enough compromise till i get a newer atmos compatible tv. Good vfm option."
"After some research only , I have placed an order for amazon fire stick, audio output is awesome which is equallent of real theater sound exprience if you use even mid level sound system also. I am using Normal Philips 5.1 system.. Bcz of this stick quality getting good output..Picture clarity also super and, also I like the firestick user interface and easy navigation along with remote Alexa voice etc.. .. Reason why I order this product is it has volume control + full HD support, my jiofi bandwidth support to stream Full HD.. as iam having good signal for jio, I am 100 percentage happy with this device, so I recommend.If you wanted get volume control and power button control select your TV brand or equallent option from setting tab, I am using this device 1st time and 1st day.. For 24 inch Sony TVIt is easy to manage.."
At first not working just stuckAfter switch onn and off couple of times and then it went open and then I switch of my TV and other systemWhen I switch on after some timeAgain stuck.
I have tried more than 4 hours to connect the device but unfortunate not able to connect while I was taking help of customer care also but they told me it will be resolved in next 24 HRS...wait for that....very bad experiences with this
"Software sound quality is much inferior to the cheapest android box in market. Db increase option has to be added. Otherwise wotking great with our Sony Bravia TV.Update after a few months : hardware is perfect, replaced all conventional cable android box etc. Deducting one star for underdeveloped software. The home page is total ads. There is no useful language filter and when we have multiple subscription it will highlight only those apps we haven't subscribed yet and we never will. Short : it wastes time outside of viewing. Design not customer oriented."
"A couple of years back my ordinary LED samsung television sound stopped working. So instead of trying to find someone to repair it, I decided to purchase a soundbar. However since then everytime we needed to watch tv, its been 3 remotes one for my existing firetv stick (5 years old before it conked out), the other for TV and finally one for the fire tv stick.With this newer generation firetv stick, the remote has integrated the power of the tv, the soundbar with volumen up/down and the stick intelligently!!  I didnt have to put any effort.Also so far the display is much better than the old generation. Must be something to do with using newer wifi technology in it."
"1. It doesn't have option to change video quality. Once on a while all of sudden the video quality drops drastically so if it had video setting option, it would be great.2. It doesn't have many apps yet and also didn't see screen casting option. Because in latest TV's, once I connect it with Wi-Fi, I can add videos to tv list via mobile without disturbing regular mobile use"
"About good thing everyone knows and explained in the product video.What I didn't like is the list of apps provided in app store. I didn't find Sony liv, voot, zee5 etc in the list and most of the apps are not relevant. Also didn't find anything to download or add in the store. If this will not sort out, I'll return."
"My fire stick stopped working so had called customer service for replacement. I was asked to place an order and was given link to order from. And after receiving the order I had to return, however now return is disabled on the old product, and i have been writing mails over mails and yet no response. Customer service call doesn't go through on the product replacement call. Ridiculous!!"
"Whenever we switch on the TV, Firestick is not switching on. We have paired the TV with this remote. When we press power button on firestick remote, TV is switching on, but not the the firestick, even the source is set as HDMI in TV. We need to power off the TV and Firestick, then poweron the TV first, then set the mode to HDMI and after few seconds we have switch on Firestick, which will eventually boot the firestick. Every time same hassle. Regret for buying this product and lost the trust on amazon brands."
I purchased 3rd generation on Jan 2nd 2022.Aft the replacement time slap I am facing the issue with volume and streaming quality. I arise my compliment to service and customer support team. But I experienced in worst way. I am not happy about this product.I totally fed up with amazon team.  My product is in less than month purchase and also under one year warranty period. But product is not in working condition. Very worst product don't go for this.
"Having owned a smart TV from Sony, this small wonder is flatly outperforming in terms of all tangible fields. My old dumb Sony TV is now smarter the new Smart TV.The UI is intuitive and Alexa support is phenomenal. All you need to tell Alexa is what you want to watch, it'll open the relevant app and hit the desired title.Must buy for those who are contemplating an upgrade to a slow smart TV if they already own a decent dumb one. This will just not disappoint and turn the tables instantly you use it."
"It's good if you only wanna watch a few select apps like YouTube or Amazon Prime or maybe some news and stuff. But if you're looking to install Jio TV then walk away. The app Store is also very limited with what you can and can't use. There was a work around to get JIO TV installed but that was a major flop. Tip - check what it can and can't run before buying. Overall you won't be disappointed with the quality. Also, if you are looking for a device that is snappy, this is not for you."
"Excellent product even if you are not subscribing for any channels like Amazon Prime or Net Flix etc. I have been using it only for watching programs in You Tube and Alexa listens and Comprehends easily. If she fails, even if you give spelling, she will search and display the programs. Even though my TV screen quality is not upto the mark, somehow, the Stick is able to give me best picture quality in streaming. This is amazing. I saw my relative family using this for showing Tenali Ramakrishna stories in You Tube and I recommended this Stick to my team for watching various You Tube Trainings on technical subjects, BPMN training and BPM training etc., The effect will be amazing.Note: If the stick fails, you will end-up paying another INR 2000 for its replacement. Hence, please download their app (while the stick is working) on another dummy smart phone and if the stick crashes, you will have a back-up."
"1) Issues related to installation of most of the apps (Jio TV, Wynk)2) No Ethernet port. Available on other product with same price ( need to purchase adapter separately)3) Go for it only if you have good knowledge of app installation and configuration4) Not able to extend memory with additional card or pen drive ( Available on other products with same or less price)5) Not able to install tatasky binge app"
"Plug and use.Super-friendly, highly responsive, intuitive UIüëç that one might not have expected from FireOS!The Fire stick updates itself and provides for apps like Disney+Hotstar, SunNxt, Netflix, Zee5, Amazon prime video and many more from its own store.Some of the apps are free, to download as well as for streaming a few free shows/movies, while the more popular apps are free to download but subscription based.The remote is brilliant and if you have connected your Amazon account with any Alexa-enabled device then it picks up your WiFi automatically as is with all Alexa devices.Voice recognition is not 5 star but pretty good.Value for money purchase if your mom or family members are into watching serials and sitcoms as they could simply pause the show at any point, watch another serial episode and return to the paused show."
"Now I have bought this new set of stick and remote becuase my previous remotes were not working. But just within 40 days of Delivery the remote has suddenly stopped working. Now what should I do?I can't replace the product nor return, should I buy a new remote, but the cost is again so high. Why the hell the remotes are so costly???"
"Last Year I ordered 2nd gen firestickSomehow at July end that firestick got some technical issues and was not working I complaint Amazon about that they told me to get new device and they will process refund for that device , I'm impressed thanks Amazon I have received the product and refund is under process thank you so much. That's what I call customer service"
"This is my second firetv stick purchase. Very disappointed with the sluggish ""Up"" navigation button/ key/ arrow on the remote. Gets stuck, slow to respond.Other navigation keys‚Äî Down, Left, Right‚Äî work fine. Surprised to find complaints online on forums etc of other customers too facing issue with Up navigation button.Overall, 2nd gen firetv stick is a more smoother experience for me. This 3rd gen is comparatively less responsive (for me).Wonder why YouTube app on firetv stick seems to come without surround sound option though it has that on chromecast puck."
I got this latest generation fire stick on a discounted price. Installation was very easy. Easy to use. It makes our normal TV a smart TV. Streaming is very smooth. I really impressed with the improved sound quality with the same 5.1 speakers which I use with other media devices. Though my home theatre is not compatible with Dolby DTS or Dolby Atmos but stil I can notice the improved sound quality when I listen anything using fire stick in compared to playing with mobile/laptop/setup box devices. Very satisfied with the product.
"I have been using the Firestick for more than a month now. From my experience, I never had any lagging in Wifi streaming. The picture quality is very good. I rarely use voice recognition, but it is fine.Overall, I am very happy that ordered the Amazon Firestick, instead of another brand that available off the shelf.Straight away go for it, worth purchasing."
"I was having 2nd Gen FireStick, but with recent SW updates, UI response was very sluggish.Apps like Sony Liv and Hotstar was getting hanged while playing contents.So this was time to retire old device and upgraded with next gen HW.Talking about Gen2 Stick, lasted for 3 Years only.Experience with New Gen HW with considering old device:1. No Lags in UI, boot time is less and app installation is very less. I selected restore settings from old device which was completed in 1-2 mins and required another 3 mins to install Hotstar, Sony Liv, Voot & Zee52. Voice search is 50 times better than older version HW3. Alexa integration is greatLets hope new device will last for more than 3 Years :)"
I already had the gen1 firetv. Bought this as was in discount. But the volume key never tuned to my HITACHI TV. The streaming of Amazon prime is bad. Screen freezes often. Sometimes goesback. Would have considered network issue but other apps work well. Used for 20days and dont know if i can replace it. Screen freezes quite frequently
"Best if you are not having a smart tv and want to convert it to one.Pros :-The streaming quality is good.Good options for apps.Inbuild Amazon Prime, Music and Netflix ButtonsThe remote syncs with the TV remote, so no need to use 2 remotes.Cons :-Sometimes the performance is slow.Alexa is Useless ( You need to have a proper English ascent )Conclusion :-Would recommend to others. As it is in budget and very easy to navigate."

"I was really looking for Atmos media player and got fooled earlier with 4k firestick which doesn't have atmos audio support.After a long research I found 3rd Gen stick supports Dolby Atmos,  I'm not worried about 4k where my receiver is capable of upscaling it.I'm giving 4Star as I still don't find Atmos in Amazon prime, Netflix does. And thanks to Amazon for delivering within 24hrs.Added photo to get the proof of Atmos, which I didn't see anyone posted earlier while I was looking for it. Thank you üëç"
"This is my 2nd streaming device. 1st one was Google Chromecast, Chromecast (the one is available in India) is also not bad but not like Amazon Fire üî• TV Stick (3rd gen, 2021), though I didn't use earlier versions of the same.The big difference is user interface of fire tv stick, having inbuilt app & app-store and a good remote (voice controlled), it is easy to use, you not required smartphone to operate the same, once settings is done. On other hand Chromecast not have interface like that, so you need a paired smartphone for operate. Picture quality of both devices are very good. Overall it's (amazon fire tv stick) a good device for converting non smart LED/LCD TV to smart TV."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Although the item was replaced once by yourself, the remote is still not working. The power button, Alexa voice button, and the volume button does not work. I am highly unsatisfied with the product. Please return, replace or refund my order."
"It‚Äôs not worth the price for two reasons.1. No adequate inbuilt wireless screen share options. The one that is there is not working. Third party softwares are a pain and quality is cheap. I wish I had ordered a different stream stick that offers built in screenshare options, they come cheaper too.2. Inbuilt memory is very less. Device got full with basic streaming apps and one game.they could have done a better job with the fire stick, by giving a good inbuilt screen share and a better memory and ram.Also, in between app navigation to find certain latest episodes is troublesome even with Alexa.It doesn‚Äôt really feel that I have ordered the latest version of fire stick.A lot of innovation still beckons to make it user friendly."
"I went through many streaming items , did a lot of research and found Amazon Fire TV Stick.I use this Fire TV Stick for below; 3rd Gen is faster I had 2nd Gen aswell.I Watch NetFlix, Sony Liv, Aha, Disney + Hotstar, Prime Video, and lots more.I stopped using my Tata Sky and purchased this.Even my 2nd Class kid use TV for mirroring through Fire Stick from phone to TV for Online Classes. he does it on his own its that easy.I would say Go for it it is worth purchasing."
"I am writing this review after using it 5 months.I got this product in Rs 2199 in sale,It's a good product under Rs 2500,The speed is good, this device has 1 gb ram but still works very good, you have to wait to load all files and apps after getting started to get its maximum speed.Lags very timesNo heating issue in devicePerformance is goodAlexa works better than Google assistantGot two batteries with this device which is still working fine.Build quality is very goodBluetooth and wifi connectivity is goodThanks"
"Fire Sticks have existed now for more than a couple of years and are quite popular. So my decision to buy one is quite late, since we had become quite accustomed to streaming everything on our laptops and haven‚Äôt bought a TV which we firmly believe is an absolute idiot box. Having said this, I‚Äôm using the Fire Stick on a computer monitor and it is an absolutely fine buy, I must admit. If I ever buy a TV it‚Äôll only be for the Fire Stick and nothing else. Will not be commenting on the functionality because many before me would have said much more. All I would want to say is that it is a really good buy for the family."
"Nice picture quality hd 1080p and also sound is good all apps  easy to install my sony 32 inch 2018'tv  but Bluetooth not connected to my home theater. Show connected but no sound... Any person can suggest me, how to solve this. Alexa not so smart ..I have suffering from hang or freeze  issue on prime video 1 min freeze but sound continue.. but other app as like hot star, zee5, Netflix have no issue..."

"Hello guys, I am writing this review post using this device for 10 days now.I am using it with Monitor and able to control volume once connected to Bluetooth speakers/ headphones (pl note that monitors inbuilt speakers volume cannot be controlled by Fire sticks remote)Though this version of fire stick is ‚Çπ1000 expensive than Lite version but totally worth it:a) Better sound outputb) remote with tv controlsc) powerful processord) MADE IN INDIA"
"This Amazon fire TV is pathetic product I receivedWhen I received order 1, the volume + was not working. Agent said to pay for remote 1999. Told him it's a brand new product which is defective. Then he placed a replacement. Received the replacement order and that stick is not getting detected in any TV.  Asked to another replacement the customer service agent said can't replace and now can only return n reorder.The cost of new is quite higher that the one I bought forAmazon seems not doing proper quality check on their products now a days...."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Remote control volume button, mute button, power button not working"
I am writing this review after using the product for more than 10 days. There is persistent wifi connectivity issue with this model. It keeps disconnecting and the speed is also not good. I kept my phone at the same spot where fire stick is attached and the Internet speed is 30 mbps on my phone whereas fire tv stick shows Internet as speed 8 mbps. I am using Mi tv stick on another TV and wifi connectivity is very good in spite of the fact that router is placed very very far.Amazon should fix this.
"You will need a tv with dolby support and also optical out along with arc, if your tv has arc but not dolby digital or atmos etc. then it will not produce surround outputI have 5.1 dolby digital soundbar and yet with bluetooth connection with that soundbar i do not get dolby digitalNeed dolby enabled tv otherwise this is not really worth buying unless you do not mind stereo output"
"I was excited to use this product but was disappointed that Remote is not at all getting paired with Fire TV stick. I tried all online troubleshooting options multiple times right from web articles to youtube videos and even spent extra money to buy new batteries but it still doesn't work as it is supposed to. I also checked recent review of the product and a lot of users including me are facing same issue with Aug-21 manufactured product. Anyone else that is going to buy the is product in current sale (Oct-21) please give it a thought for now. Maybe buy in next sale and if lucky we won't get Aug-21 manufactured product with issues. Finally, returning this product. Will probably buy it again in next sale and hoping to get lucky that time."
During first time installation my Wifi did not connect. I am not sure whether it is because of HDMI adapter not used since in manual mentioned to use HDMI adapter for better network connectivity. Later I connected with HDMI adapter but still Wifi did not connect. Later I tried with my Mobile hotspot then it connected and updated the software. After that I tried to connect with my Wifi then it got connected. So I won't say this as a complaint but sharing my experience. So when you are trying to install it for first time better have a alternate network connection available.Pros:1. Volume and power button helps really well2. Very fast while using apps3. Even you can play gamesCons:1. I feel bit costly (only for added button features)
"Got this device on prime day sale - with all discounts this just costed me Rs.1890/-. Totally worth the money!Has the Display Mirroring option too - can easily cast mobile screen to this.Also has many VPN free apps, i love Windscribe VPN - connect to any server across the world and watch any content online. I usually watch cricket, tennis on some youtube channels which don't have rights to play livestream for India servers.So it's totally worth a buy for me. Need to explore a lot more though as i received the device couple of hours ago!"
"The device is good in terms of streaming quality but I have an issue with audio. It has a feature called home theater where you can connect the stick and your Echo, but whenever I do that, the device always freezes. Tech support already replaced id twice but the same issue on all the replacements as well. They say that the device is disconnecting from network, of course it disconnects cause when it freezes it is  no longer connected to wifi. Sometimes they tell its my Echo and some times they tell its the fire stick. I factory reset my router, echo and the fire stick multiple times and I just gave up on this. Tech support says they will call back with an update but they never do, pathetic service by Amazon.Then I thought I would connect the fire stick via Bluetooth to the echo, guess what that also does not work. The audio is barely audible even at maximum level, when contacting the tech support for this issue, they gave me the same troubleshooting steps as before and then when nothing worked, THEY JUST SAID THAT THEY WILL TAKE FEEDBACK. NO RESOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM!!!!!!!!! Even the supervisors are not able to help me out, so now I have got a fire stick which does not work with external audio sources and I am stuck to use it via the worse speakers of my TV.I am MORE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TECH SUPPORT I RECEIVED THAN THE DEVICE."
"This Tv stick is a awesome,  superb picture quality, no lags, getting dolby digital plus sound via my zebronics soundbar & also i found the way to control sound bar via fire TV remote, manually enter IR PROFILE NUMBER 4819 in advance options or select the Soundbar Brand ""ABox"" in list to control volume of the Zebronics 9400 pro Dolby Digital soundbar via Fire Tv Remote.Hit helpful button if it worked for you."
Not worth. Freezes always. You can't reboot using remote. You have to unplug and plug it again. Frustrating.
"Product is good and worth to buy for Ordinary or non-Smart TV. Streaming quality is good as long as you have better internet connection with constant minimum around 7mbps speed. Power Off and Volume button should be manually configured which I learnt recently; Google search for instructions. Not all apps (like sunnxt, aha, etc) are optimised for firetv; takes more time or runs in background even after exiting. Price is bit high normally but I bought during the offer so I am happy with it."
"This 3rd gen FireTV Stick is useless if you want to watch Sonyliv, Voot or Lionsgate...All these apps aren't compatible and you don't get an option to install it.Many applications available which don't get streamed in India."
"picture and audio quality is very good. but cant add live channels to fav list. Only Voot channels are allowed to add. Couldnt find any option to add fav channel, so every time if i want to see any specific channel, I need to find app and then need to find live channesl in that app and then only i can play that channel. This sucks. Alex also not able to identify several channels and couldnt play it. It also didnt recognize marathi channel names."
"I received this firestick a few weeks back and started using it. I noticed two weird things:1. The battery cover is veryyy loose on the remote and keeps slipping off.2. Sometimes mid-streaming the screen blacks out and I'm unable to go back or go home - the remote and screen both stop working and I have to restart the TV to make it work again.Otherwise, serves the purpose well."
1: I had a previous generation stick and I upgraded to this one for the new UI and supposedly faster response time. I was sadly mistaken. The UI lags if not for the worst from previous generation and I don't see any difference in opening of apps as well2: The battery cover is flimsy and keep coming off.3: In general I didn't like the new UI over the old one. It can be subjective.
"Item could not be installed since the HDMI cable is very short for a wall mounted TV.  I had an HDMI cable, but could not use it since it has male/male ends. Had to buy a female/female extender and now waiting for two days to install. Amazon should give at least a one meter cable."
Hello teamThe remote is not working.I paid Rs 4000 and and the volume button and the power button does not work.I used to use it in 1 house and again tested after one month in another house and again same problem.Pleade replace the item or send a technician to check the remote and but wont pay a visit to the technician as this is the company's  fault and this is the company's product.
I'm writing review after 10 days of usage. I received faulty product. Disconnected automatically during initial setup and therefore I had to reset factory many times.There's no doubt about picture and sound quality however software could have been improved a bit. Its frequently lagging and sometimes hang completely and immediately required turn off device itself.Alexa voice isn't upto the mark. Sometimes failed to display results from asked voice command.Finally I have decided to return with lots of disappointments.
I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. I got this at price range of 2400 at Croma and offer salePros: those who are looking for lag free experience then go for this .Alexa is working fine .Stream quality is good.Cable length is large easily more than 1 meter length and also batteries have been provided in the box itself for the remote.Cons: since the quality of the remote seems to be delicate should need to handle with care.Some apps while multi tasking one over other seems to be little bit of lag(better than other sticks if u compare).Finally if u guys buy with extended warranty buy in online or if not buy in offline stores .
"Amazing device, whether you have a smart tv or not (HDMI input & good Internet connection required). I have an LG smart tv which doesn't support some apps, so went for Airtel Xstream box which gets stuck once in a day or two days. It was quite irritating. Bought this on Amazon prime day and got it for just 2k .. seamless connectivity and great streaming with loads of features and as a plus you get some OTT's free. Overall great product to have. Bought another one during Independence day sale but had to pay 2.7k for 2nd tv. Of course you need to have a good internet connection with 100 Mbps speed or as suggested to best performance. One thing I don't like is the voice recognition, sometimes it doesn't show what you are looking for."
"My smart TV has problems connecting to Wifi and disconnects randomly. I decided to try FireTV and I must say, it manages to stay connected and not disrupt my viewing experience at all. The streaming quality is great and it is very easy to use. Kudos to Amazon for the product and fast delivery."
"Got this for ‚Çπ2099/- during prime day sale!Streaming quality - 10/10Voice recognition - 8/10Ease of use - 10/10We just discontinued using our DTH, it's that great and efficient. We're anyhow using a 200mbps unlimited broadband and this thing utilises full potential of internet. We don't feel like our money is getting wasted for internet connection or DTH. The fact that it requires only a fraction of electricity what DTH set top box uses is a cherry on the cake :)I would recommend this to anyone who uses a TV with no smart features. You won't regret..."
"I never thought that fire stick can do muchAfter I use its simply awesome.Terrific performanceBundles of applicationsLoaded with stuffsAnd has a remote control with volume button. It use a lotAnd the sound quality just mind blowing I have small JBL 2.1 I never get sound as much am enjoying now with firesrickI was pretty upset on my choice of soundbar when I connected to firesrick it simply boost the sound like theater.Even you can browse and watch movies from third party sites like tamil rockersMy old sony TV become smart. Make your home smarter too, if you have old TVEven you are having smart TV firesrick is the best option easy to browse and controlOnly one problemIt swallow your data beyond your imagination 10GB data for one movie on primeSo if you dont mind about dataGo aheadBe a Happy customer!"
The gadget is a rebirth or upgradation of a non - Android television into an Android tv which was a dream for people like me. But as some of the things are still there which feels that lack of an Android tv like at some points the tv lags in streaming even over 40mbps wifi. I can understand that this device can't make my normal tv a perfect Android tv so i just accept that little drawback other than live streaming the device works extremely well on watching videos in best quality (1080p) with no bufferings. Satisfied with the product at all.
"VI TV & Movies, JIO TV apps are not available in app store.  You have to download it externally using google search (as suggested by customer care officer @ your own risk) but again once you download, it couldn't play like how other apps (Prime video) plays.  If these apps can be available here then there is no need to have separate d2h or cable connection for watching TV. Otherwise overall it's the best."
1. My tv is just HD yet quality of the video is like 4K.2. Can screen cast from android and from iPhone as well but we have to install app from the store which is easy and free.3. I see most of the apps available that I use except wync.4. Quick and fast and work with voice as well. (Alexa)
I had order all type of new Fire TV stick and all of them were not supported with Kodak TV. Old model is supported with my TV. Please provide right compatibility chart so that customer can review and buy.
"This is a great little device, speedy than previous one and streaming is top notch. Best to get during sale days as it‚Äôs quite expensive otherwise.I have the 2nd gen as well but it is slower and has issues in remote however this one is surely an improvement obviously.The delivery was on time and well packaged, still a better choice than the default sluggish interface of android in the so called newer smart tvs.Amazon seems to have an issue with Disney Hotstar as it‚Äôs recommendations are not shown on home page and that is a bad thing since I have a premium membership of that streaming service.Overall a very good product that serves its purpose."
3rd generation  amazon fire stick is best embedded product have ever seen. Such a small seamless product which made an old 60k lcd TV a smart Tv. Ui ux so good even kids r surfing all apps without training.Amazon shud add more apps on amazon prime subsricptions as managing multiple subscription is a challenge.fire stick is not just for entertainment but kids can access online learning content n video conferencing apps like google class room on normal hd tv via amazon silk browser where children dont suffer mobile screnn nausea n fatigue
The product is a real gem. I have bought this 2nd time. First was 2nd generation one. I should have given 5 star for the product compare to price. I got it for Rs. 2099.00 on prime day sale. This was an irresistible deal. But I have given 2 star for the product to get attention the bug I am going to talk about. On my 2nd Gen Fire Stick when I connect to my Bluetooth Jbl Sound Bar it can play Dolby Digital Plus. I get the option to choose to play Dolby Digital Plus or only stereo. But on my 3rd Gen fire stick when I connect my Jbl sound bar via bluetooth it only shows stereo. I can't play Dolby Digial Plus via bluetooth. I have tried every possible way to play. But it can't. I hope it will be fixed very soon.
"A company that cannot make good hardware should not try making one. The remote acts super weird, I stopped using it after the first two days. The device doesn't connect to the internet most of the time. Same TV is streaming Netflix directly without any issues and this device says, No Internet Connection. Bad product from Amazon. @Amazon, do not create things just because you can.Waste of money."
This is a must have product for everyone in home I can turn this into my HDMI projector and works very well it make my projector as a smart TV I can take this everywhere with my projector and it this working like butter smooth quality videos very good content from prime video Netflix Amazon Disney hotstar everything I am enjoying this device very much I recommend everyone to buy this products thank you
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Worst experience, waited eagerly for this product. I can give 0.1% good review for only picture quality. So much of Delay between remote and stick, bluetooth device connected but no output. Rest of all the options are worst. I will not suggest anyone this product. Really really worst product worst experience infront of all family members. Everyone laughed at me."
"I'm very happy, and totally satisfied with firetv.It is far better than any stock Android TV, because it is lag free and way easier to nevigate through different functions.Moreover Alexa remote is fabulous it's never disappoint me and always understand Indian English, hindi easily.So it can be say that overall experience is awesome and i started tv for improvement in knowledge....rather than wasting time earlier."
Well I already had a smart TV and  I felt pity for the remote for its stress and pressure it‚Äôs always undergoing ... Fire stick came as a boon to it... now my TV remote is sitting back and relaxing üòå with minimal of job and burning the AAA battery...Amazon fire stick has a perfect voice recognition facility.. now I bitterly regret of  having my TV remote replaced thrice and polluting the environment....üòä
"And better than a smart tv. I have a android tv stick also, no difference between boath tv sticks in usability. But fire tv stick need same more technical knowledge for configuring audio control, voice recognition and setting up alaxa. Google it and do yours self. Amazon fire tv stick is good choice for nonsmart tv users"
I have an LG smart tv (bought in 2012 i guess) which doesnt connect to a wireless network and so i was sceptical about the purchase. I was however supposed to give it to a relative if it wouldnt work. But i was thrilled to see that it worked wonderfully. Setting it up was easy. My family enjoys the  streaming quality.
"I bought this because the latest Chromecast by Google is not available in India. The price to performance is not justified, this product should not cost more than 2.5k. The current price of 4k is completely unreasonable. Don't buy it unless there is an ongoing sale on it. And yes never get distracted by the discount percentages on Amazon for anything. Those percentages are manipulated by changing the MRP here and there. Now talking about the performance of the product, the U.I is better than previous generation of fire stick, the booting time is longer than the previous generation but once it's on it's indeed faster (I know this because I have the previous version as well which I have been using since 2 yrs). To sum up its the best amoung the limited choices that we have, but yes only if you get it under 3K."
Worth buying.. using it in my LCD TV.. initially I was little doubtful whether the firestick ll work in it or not... but it is working amazingly..1. Streaming quality is simpky mind blowing.. very good picture quality too2. Alexa integration and voice recognition is simply amazing...This firestick has made TV viewing a completely new and amazing experience..
"I was toying with the idea of replacing my 9 year old 40 inch samsung 3D TV which is even by today‚Äôs standard thin  and has Full HD display although it is working perfectly well because it was not ""smart""; and I had to watch Netflix, Amazon prime etc on my laptop! This 4000 Rupee dongle which is not even visible when plugged in, saved me! Just plug it onto the HDMI port, follow the installation instruction and you got a perfect smart TV."
"The best product from Amazon. MyTV is an old sony bravio with only HDMI port, i was thinking it cant be converted to an internet TV, but this innovation made it possible.Very easy to installationHassel freeCompact product."
"In Advance sound settings ' Volume Leveler & Voice Enhancer ' do not keep to "" Set ON "" position . Failed to handle these points & purchased a new Firestick with assurance that new one will solve the problem. But it is same as before. Nobody noticed it ? strange."
"I am writing the review after 1 full week of use. Below is the detail review :-Device Price/cost ::-I purchased Amazin fire tv stick plus which cost me around 3099/- rs with Sony liv + Zee5 + Voot annual subscription.U can lso purchase non subscription product but the difference is just 300 Rs and in which u get 1700/- rs of benifits.Please note without apps subscription the device is just playing You tube only. So. I recommended atleast get Prime and hotstar subscriptionStreaming quality ::-great streaming quality, convert your normal TV device in smart device, Internet connection required nand believe me just 5-10 mbps plan is enough to stream on full HD.Subscription activation ::-Believe me Sony Liv and voot can be subscribed without any problem. U jtt need to install the app and its showing u that u get the 1year membership and showing u a url, run it on yiur mobile device and enter the code which showing on Fire tv stick screen your subscription is started, u can also use it on your other mobile and PC Device as well.ZEE 5 Subscription ::-This is the most searched topic for this product, i also require Amazin customer care help to start this but by watching few You tube video i get how to start ZEE5.Its just simple you just need to clear cache and clear data of the app then uninstall the app and install it.And it shows 2 option u just chose 2nd one which was login with Amazon account and enter the OTP come on your Amazon account email and jayt after entering OTP,  It  will shows you the annual subscription.Please note if still it not helped again reinstall it 2nd time it will surely started."
All good but only one consAll live channels from zee5 subscriptions will not show under Live Channels list. I mean all live channels from all the loaded apps will not sync under Live channel List. So to watch those channels I have to go into individual apps and check.
Perfect to my projector. If has inbuilt Bluetooth transmitter. So you can pair your Bluetooth enabled sound bar and enjoy surround sound experience. It has auto update which will bring firmware upto date.  Batteries are also included. Nice one  from Amazon. Got in a summer sale discount.
"While adding tv(ONIDA MARVEL LED 32"") in equipment, first it ask for power on/off which work well on IR PROFILE CODE #586 only but doesn't work on next step volume. When I contacted customer support they said firetv stick remote volume button is not working and advice reorder new remote.. But when I added Bluetooth speakers to firetv, the firetv remote volume working for speakers. That's means Developers need to updates IR PROFILE CODE #586 for Onida Marvel Led 32"" Tv. Just for volume control I have ordered Amazon Firetv Stick 3rd gen.. If it doesn't work for my tv then it is useless. So it is better to buy 2nd gen firetv stick which 1000 rupees less in cost."
It is perfect. Firsty I'm very confused between fire tv stick and mi 4k box. But 10 day return policy help me to decide. And now fire tv stick is best. Remote is good amd easy to handle. I have get this with Rs 2799 only in the Sale. So wait for the sale to buy fire tv stick.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Cheated, Costly buy, goes to sleep in mode, fire tv remote app does not works properly, cannot awake from app, problem in connecting sound bar, accessories very costly. Better products available than this."
"The Amazon Fire TV Stick (3rd Gen) is a full-HD streaming device priced at INR 2,700. It is meant for use with affordable televisions and gets easily plugged into the HDMI port of your television. Powered by the MediaTek MT8695D processor, it runs on Amazon's Fire OS 7 (based on Android 9) and is supported by 1GB of RAM. It includes all major apps and services are supported on Fire OS, such as Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, and YouTube, in addition to Amazon's own Prime Video. Fire OS also supports the Apple TV app, which currently isn't available on the Android TV platform.The Amazon Fire TV Stick (3rd Gen) delivers much of the same experience as the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K in terms of streaming. The UI is easy to use, performance is reliable and its wide app support makes this the best full-HD streaming device you can buy today."
"I have been using the product for the last 3/4 months, but the Remote suddenly stopped working from yesterday. I tried all the methods given in the Amazon product care, like changing the batteries, relinking the remote, unplugging the firestick and plugging it again, etc. etc., but the remote just doesn't work. Would be great if someone could tell the solution, or replace the product...."
I grabbed TV Stick in the best deal for just Rs 1890 in prime days sale. It is the best media streaming device in the market for this price. The device is just awesome in every aspect. Using it with my 40 inches BPL (Non Android) LED TV.
"Guys at Amazon!! - This is seriously sad about the kind of product, that I have received. The first Fire TV Stick was not getting paired with the remote and the replacement was received today and it was the same issue. The Stick was responding to few commands to the remote through the app on the phone but going back to the screen which says ""Pair your remote"". The physical remote was not getting paired. Your tech guys took the remote access of my TV screen and tried their bit but still no luck. This is sad that you guys don't have any QC done even for a replacement product. The whole business of me wanting to change from Chromecast to Fire TV has become a futile one. The purpose of getting an Echo along with this is also become redundant. So I don't know what do do the Echo too. Now there is no more replacement according to you guys and it will be a refund. And again being a more than a regular user and purchaser of products through Amazon this is very depressing. Hope you guys can do something about it to me because the point of getting a product is have it put to use. Refund's doesn't work."
My fire tv remote is not working properly and i don't know from where to claim the warranty please help and tell me how to replace or fix remote with warranty i see no option to claim it help please. I got really fed up.
"Very very excellent product, firstly I buy fire tv stick lite then I bought this fire tv stick 3 gen, both are same but only difference is remote.Both are compatable with my sony bravia tv.It's your choose who's you want to buy.And i get it day before from it's delivery date.THANK YOU AMAZON AND SELLERüåπ"
"I was forced to buy Firestick 3rd generation after my Amazon Firestick First Generation stopped working. It was working fine till afternoon and after showing Software update in progress, it got stuck and never worked.I called up the Executive and after trying everything was asked to take it to nearby center. As the center is quite far, I didn't go, but ordered the third generation instead.And i really loved this product."
"I have always been a fan of Amazon Fire Stick and this is my second device. The remote is a gem.One thing I realised is if it would have a custom button option down below so users can set any app as per their choice. That would be amazing. I suppose Amazon will roll this update this feature in their upcoming releases üôÇenjoying the product. Packaging was ok, the delivery was before the expected date so I am happy.It also works great with monitors with VGA cable connected to a HDMI to VGA converter.The remote doesn't work for me because it's an IR blaster. I expected it to control the volume from the firestick itself because I am using it on my monitor and connected a speaker to it."
"Lot of thanks to Amazon for this awesome product.Best way to convert your Old LED TV into Smart TV.Android version is latest hence very smooth.Streaming quality is perfect of you have good bandwidth.I have closed my Cable Tv connection after using Fire Tv stick.Alexa integration is so perfect that you need not to type anything.Overall, Love the Product."
Navigation on Voice/Alexa is a little exerciseOne drawback which Amazon needs to fix on Alexa or Fire TV Stick is connectivity on 2.4 GHz router which takes at least 10 - 15 minutes to connect where in connects instantly on 5 GHz. Just for this bug users should switch to a new router... does not make sense
"It's fine and from specs, it's a powerful device. However, ads and sponsored content on the home page are very distractive and slow the device down. Please give an option to remove them. Otherwise it's just fine."
"I upgraded to this latest gen from the first gen Fire TV stick.My main reason for upgrading was the lack of TV controls and the interface bogged down a bit which made it a little irritating to use.Now coming to the product, I‚Äôm utterly disappointed with the build quality of the remote.  It feels like it would shatter after a few drops. The fit and finish is subpar and the rubber used on the buttons attracts a lot of dust. Once you hold this product in your hand, you‚Äôll immediately tell that it‚Äôs a very cheap product. The first gen felt a lot more premium.When it comes to the software aspect, it feels smooth and there are no lags. The new interface looks nice and the Alexa integration is nicely done.However, I do not like the frequent ads that are displayed in between episodes on Prime Video.Is it worth the MRP? Absolutely not.Is it worth buying during a sale after heavy discount? Yes, maybe."
This 2021 version rocks!!! I have just installed in my samsung led tv without power adapter by directly plugging it in 1v usb drive and its working like a charm‚Ä¶ i was quite concern about managing tangled wire but this really solved my problem definitely worth buying
"It really serves the purpose of turning my tv into Smart tv. I had a samsung tv with Tizen OS so there was a limitation of apps and even some apps were not working properly but after putting the Firestick...the overall UI, speed, Alexa etc is working superb. No complaints till now... it really serves the purpose of buying the same and it's worthed. Thanks Amazon."
"This product is good for people like me who like to use streaming services a lot. Like YouTube, prime video and Netflix. Now with the new remote everything is easily accessible through hot keys. The streaming quality is excellent. Haven't faced any issue so far."
Fire stick is always a bench mark. This is my second fire stick and I am not happy with its power adapter. It keep restarting the Fire Stick again and again within every few minutes. I replace the product but again I am facing same power adapter issue. I am using Amazon fire Stick with a MI mobile charger :( . If Amazon is reviewing this comment please cross check the power adapters power output.
"This is the best gadget for converting non=smart tv into smart tv. Remove is additional direct buttons for Prime Video, Prime Music, Netflix and Apps. Most important thing is I liked too much is volume is controlled by fire stick. This feature was missing in the previous one."
"*MUST READ*The product and the packaging was extremely good. I first thought that it might have been damaged because the packages brought by the delivery man were on top of each other. The fire stick OS is absolutely phenomenal. The best thing is that we don't have to pay any NCF fees or that just to stream on free applications. It is all good but sometimes it lags maybe due to my internet connection. In the third day of this I faced problems with my remote,I thought that it might be a problem of my TV but it wasn't, all other remote buttons were working just fine. I started panicking as it was my first time having a streaming device. The next day, I changed the batteries of the remote and it started working flawlessly. I am satisfied as I now cannot return my product as it will cost me almost double the cost I paid for it. Hopefully it works beautifully and without any lag in the future. Hoping for the bestüëçüèºüôèüèº"
Let‚Äôs talk about fire stick generation 3rd. The device is well built and have nice build quality. Installation setup is very easy and quick. I have android tv also if I compare both fire stick is quite fast. The most positive point is it‚Äôs speed and response time. Android tv get slow with time. I think voice command should be improved a bit according to Indian accent and battery cover should be bit more tighter which will make it long lasting to stay.
"Best device if you have non smart tv, convert to smart features like connect with blutooth headphone üéß, For separately uses. You can play YouTube Full HD clarity it's awesome. Everything is fine, Remote size small is ok but build quality nd plastic material is not adaptive...'Voice recognition' have also trouble - speaks something, hears something else..."
"Latest version of fire tv stick is amazing, UI modified and user friendly.remote sync is automated and easy now. New remote have more options now ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòç like volume controls, direct dedicates shortcut buttons for next flix, Amazon Prime video and for apps."
Pros :1. Fast steaming2. Smooth Access3. Voice recognitionCons:1. Storage Issue2. Limited apps3. Can't access any free TV4. Only remote is different (better go for lite)5. No external storage
"Connected the Firestick to TV. When signing in to my Amazon account, it is asking me to sign into amazon.uk account. I anyway put in my amazon.in username and password, but it is not accepting it. I don't have a UK account. What do I do?"
"It has some cons and pros;-Talking about cons:-1. Often not able to connect to wifi even when it is  available and other devices are connected to it  at the same distance.2.  Sometimes it shows remote is not paired.3.  The hotkeys sometimes behave abnormally like  when you press it, it will restart the device. I  have to switch off the tv and rrestart.Now pros:-1. Navigation was butter2. Full hd content3. Easy UI4. U can also extend storage by using spiltter, although not required till now.My conclusionI ordered a replacement because of above stated cons but in general device is good."
M using Samsung 20 inch pc moniter via hdmi converter and it's work fine.... Also 1080 n HD play... You can use sound Bluetooth speaker.. M using alexa echo dot portable speaker is work fine no sound lac while using TV.. Live channel work properly.. Remote control sound +- also work... But moniter don't off via fire stick remote but television is off on via remote monitor don't off on... It's very useful product... I phurche time it's coat 2399rs
To watch live channels we hav to always open related app. For example if you want to watch sab tv you hav to open sony live app. Live channels list is not showing in interface. We can not even see program timings. In home page interface  not a single live channel is showing. This problem is having only in fire stick 2021. So  it is nightmare to reach at live channels. Not showing ON NOW  option on home page. Not showing channel guide. If you command alexa to open aaj tak or any other live channel it will not show the specific live channel. This is software issue. Could be resolved in future. Till now not enjoying all the benefits of fire stick 2021. Very disappointed. Thinking to replace it with old fire stick having all the features.
Good value for money as it's a step towards home automation control and away from not so exciting Chromecast. Ease of use and setup make it idiot friendly. Amazon needs to improve and focus on media content and ensure high quality HD content for any apps that are hosted on the firestick platform.
"Everything is good and perfect except zee5 app. If you have zee5 premium subscription and planning to watch live channels with ease then forget it my friend. You can watch live channels under going in zee5 app but not access in live section feature of fire tv. Only some channels of zee5 is showing. Beside it, every app is running fine. Not sure with Sony liv app whether its live channel is showing or not. Haven't tested , will test it soon."
This is awesome1) The picture quality and the audio.2) The build quality is great.3) Voice recognition works perfectly fine.4) The fire tv stick software is very smooth.Areas of development -1) Increase the RAM2) Option to install Jio TV
"Got this product in 2399/- in July 2021 Sale. This is worth at such low price.FireStick by Amazon is awesome and the device is of good quality.Simple to Connect and easy to configure. Connected to TV and it was Yipeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.This is my second Firestick for another TV and this one is 3rd Gen 2021.Very Good Product, it has curbed down the theater expenses giving a real dolby digital feeling at home (if you have home theater system). All movies are immediately released on OTT and hence, Theaters are now a Vintage. Go get a fire stick for you and enjoy."
"I have a broadband connection with 150Mbps speed limit, hence replaced my DTH with Fire TV which is much more than a DTH. Would recommend to go for it and convert your non smart LED TV to a smart one if you have a broadband connection with decent speed. Since nearly every channel is there Live on YouTube or JioTV it is better to get rid of your monthly DTH bills. Gives great streaming quality with almost zero buffering for me. Absolutely content with the product."
"This is my first fire TV stick. I wanted to upgrade TV but finally decided to make it smart by this device. I am happy with this decision. Saved almost 65000/- for sony 50"" TV.Performance wise it is very smooth. No lagging of picture. Sound quality is awesome.  New version of remote with additional buttons is very time saving."
"Having Sanyo 43"" FHD TV and Fire Stick is working without any issue. connected 5.1 Philips Speaker using Bluetooth option in fire stick to get Home Theatre effect and overall its value for money and not at all disappointed by buying this product."
"There are two devices 1.Amazon Fire Stick and 2.Mi . Personally I love Mi devices. But after thorough analysis, I find this Amazon Fire Stick HD version to be little bit on higher class quality.Streaming speed is great. Alexa is doing good. Space saving. Lot of daily use streaming apps are there. Games are there.But one thing is the remote should be more hard. I have bought the device through Times prime subscription at a relatively cheaper price. Expecting to use it for a long time."
"If I select one app in menu don't I suppose to see programs from that app below.  If not what is purpose of that  tab like UI. It will be best if there are two rows ""watch list "" and ""continues watching "" from each app will be shown below once that app is selected in home page  horizontal menu.  No need to open app and navigate through to open my favorite program which I am excited to see."
I got the firestick on 28th of july . But after using for 2 hours remote stopped working . I tried replacing the batteries but still it wasn't working . So i contacted customer service and they gave some instructions but still no luck.  So finally they generated the replace option and i gave the pickup location. But even after 5 days they didn't pickup . So again i contacted customer service now they're saying there's no pickup and I've to send it myself through courier.
Brilliant Option to convert your normal TV to Smart TV. Instead of buying Smart TV please go with fire stick.After Buying the smart tv few years you will get the APP updates after2 to 3 years you will not receive the APP updates in your TV.I really liked the ease of installation and quality of the videos..
"Loading issue: at initial point it won't directly connect to wifi, always need to click on retry connect.Streaming: if network connection goes off no any keys or remote will not respond.Sound: sometimes external audio like echo dot disconnected automatically.A refresh or reconnect can't managed by its OS, incase if any device disconnected.Alexa voice recognition is not good as compare to other voice trigger."
"I used this device and i am also having mi box. its not properly manage audio. Its audio quality low as compared mi box. I have used it with my 24 inch hdmi monitor and sundbar with it. its volume switched not working with it i know its for managing direct led tv but it should also support this to manage stick output device, that is supported in mi box. So i am not using for my personal use i switch it with my tv mi box."
Go to Settings / Display & Audio / Audio / Advanced Audio - there are 2 settings for Volume Leveller and Dialogue EnhancerThey are OFF by default. Turn both ON and exit and go watch something and come back in some time.They will have turned OFF miraculously. Its very annoying !!!Got the device replaced but problem still exists. So be aware before buying...Asked for upgrade to 4K stick but they can only refund now.Disappointing product.
"I bought this for rupees 2,200 in a sale almost 3 months ago and I think this is best product for u if u don't have smart tv. At rupees 2,200 this is the best  for the price . I would don't recommend you to buy this for rupee 3,000 because there are other good options at this price range . If you  are getting this product for below repees 2400 just buy it .Let's talk about the pros and consPros -1. Value for money (I bought this for rupees 2,200)2. Good interface or ui3. Remort quality is good4. Remort can control both tv and fire tv  StickCons-1. Ui lags sometimes2. The ui is based on android but there is  No play store so u can't download many  apps dricectly For given app store (you  can download some of the apps with  another ways3. There is no pendrive slot4. Voice integration is not that good ( like  3.5 out of 5 starsCONCLUSION (must read) - this is best smart tv divice below rupees 2,400 . You should not buy is for rupees 3,000 as there are other options ."
"This is my third fire stick and bought all generations of fire sticks. Voice search, on/off button, volume inc/dec are new features. Remote looks sleek and trendy. Two of my four led tvs are non-smart and Amazon fire stick is working so well on these. Of course now it is slowly becoming redundant with more and more smart tvs coming."
All very good except Bluetooth audio didn‚Äôt work. Tried to return or replace the stick with customer care while it was in return window I was told it will work please update software and no need to return and it‚Äôs been month still not working and no update from fire stock department. Very unprofessional behaviour from amazon fire stick department with business customers also.
"This fire stick need high quality internet connection and you have to use own amazon prime , Netflix, hotstar ID.If high quality internet required , then why not jio fiber or airtel xstreem"
I could not pair the remote with the fire stick. Followed all the instructions.  Sad part is Amazon doesn't let you contact them. You go to customer service then choose products and either replace it or get a refund if eligible. There is no basic support where you can ask someone few questions. Sone simple details can avoid a lot of unnecessary returns and refunds.
"Amazing product by amazon which supports streaming of many entertainment apps like amazon prime video, Netflix, Youtube and so on.... for watching movies, series, documentary, live news, cooking show and many more. Best part is inbuilt features like voice command alexa which listen to your request and plays based on the available search list and it supports dolby atmos plus feature which is an add on to the feature list. We have used it in Tv and projector, it works very well and no complaints so far. Best product to buy which is reliable, portable, good packaging and easy to use."
"This is really an amazing product. I have been using Fire Stick since 2017. Now I have upgraded to this latest model. It makes viewing experience very smart. You can easily convert your normal HDMI supported TV into a smart TV and access wide range of applications. The sound and picture quality is superb. The features on the remote are awesome. It has smart mirroring from mobile, Bluetooth connectivity, WiFi etc. Overall a must buy product!! Thanks."
"Installation was super easy. However pls ensure that you have (a) good broad band connection, (b) your TV has a spare HDMI port and (c) you are subscribed with Prime, Netflix etc.I would say this is the easiest way to convert your TV to a smart TV. Recommended buy"
Review after 4 monthStuck on initial screenNo remote workNo reset worksNow no one to solve puzzleComplete wasteTill 4 months works good but now deadReview edited now againGot call from Amazon after posting reviewAnd they sort out my problem replacing with new one.
It doesn't support to Toshiba TvMay be list of supported tv should be mentionedSo that customers will review before buyingTotally waste of moneyDoesn't recommend to any one
"After connecting this firestick, the TV's color setting profile is automatically get changed to Auto. (Where as I am keeping the Color profile as Cinema). Initially I though its my TV's problem. but this is only happening when I use the firestick. I am using this with Sony Bravia 43"" LED (non smart)."
I bought this for my mother as she watches videos of our village in youtube. Since she doesn't know how to operate electronic gadgets i thought this voice controlled version would help her watch it on tv and would not require others help. It turnes out alexa is so dumb that it cant search youtube video from home screen. You have to enter youtube app first which we dont have a dedicated button for. Whole purpose of buying this product is failed as it is very difficult to use for my parents.
"I like everything about fire tv stick. It is awesome. It solved my problems, as I used to watch the web contents by tagging my laptop. Now, I can view all the web OTT platforms through click of the remote.Fire stick TV change the ordinary TV to a smart TV."
"Amazon/ Amazing Quality, I use with ultrafast fibre net connection >100mbps, smooth streaming of YouTube, Prime, HotStar & SonyLiv, Amazn...ing spins quality. Go for it 10/10 to Amazon product IT team for developing such a brilliant product. I have stopped using AppleTV & Chromecast. üëç"
"I was a bit confused to Buy Smart TV or Amazon Fire TV Stick because the Condition of my current TV is really good and I don't want to replace it as of now but I was wasting Money on Monthly Recharge and still struggling with limited stuff to Watch. Now At the Price of 3999, the Experience is completely different after Buying this Product and on the other side, Costing of a Smart TV is a Minimum of 16-17k. Alexa Voice Control is really Cool I can watch whatever I want. Just One thing Amazon Could have been done better, prime membership atleast for a month because it's an Amazon product and they should have provided their member for Customer Experience."
"I bought a Amazon Firestick (3rd Generation) on 14th January. I noticed that during the course of a movie- Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney Hotstar etc. the SOUND would disappear. I wanted to observe some more but the problem continued. I wanted to order a replacement before one month but saw that the return should have been done before 28th January - within TWO WEEKS. I am disappointed."
The Amazon fire tv is superb.I was very happy using it.It worked for one year without any problem.Now the remote is not working.And to buy a new remote it costs Rs 2000 which is too expensive.small request to you Amazon pls lower your rates of the remote.My fire tv is useless now without remote.My kids r fed-up without it.pls help.
"Tried with 2 different TVs of different brands but this fire stick failed to start pairing with the remote. Ordered replacement though dont know will again get defective piece or what. I dont know whats wrong with amazon, since past 2 times the electronic items i order have been sent faulty in the first time, ordering replacements wastes time aswell and amazon will gradually loose customers"
"After I started using this with my TV, it is randomly starting to play in the middle of the night and abruptly goes off while watching something. That's it am not using my TV anymore. Atleast before I was using other normal apps now even that is gone. I wont recommend this"
Trying to configure it from past 3-4 days since I received it but it is not recognizing Wi-Fi. I don't understand whether I got a faulty product or there is an issue with my router!? I'm just pissed off. Want to give 0 star. Waste of money. Will return the item.‚òπüòìüò†
I had been using Chromecast for past 2-3 years and it worked well. But recently started giving too many cast issues and decided to buy firestick.The firestick is very good with playing content without any buffering issues.It's seamless and a great replacement for Chromecast!!
"Everything fine except the Bluetooth earphones volume is low even when you set the volume 100% level......even the call center technicians could not figure out the problem.My bedroom TV has a 2nd generation fire tv stick, the same Bluetooth headset works great somuch as I have to keep the volume at 70% of max level..."
Excellent product. I'm using this fire TV stick on my Micromax tv which is very old and tv model is 2015 so it's normal tv and this stick works fine and made my normal tv into a Android tv. Excellent streaming and no lag till now. Worth every penny.
Its wonderfullMy normal Led tv converted to smart tvIm soooo much impressed by this productThanq u amazon for saving my moneyIf not i have to go for a new tv by exchange which results in loss of nearly 20kThnk u soooo much
"Nice way to convert non smart TV to Smart one. But underperforms in several areas1. User interface is not user friendly, specially the elderly ones faces hard time to manage2. Remote volume and power buttons not pairing with several tv models. Magic eye configuration would have been a better option.3. Alexa voice control is really poor4. Appstore is really missing several good TV apps like ditto TV, Jio Tv etc forcing users to use hacks or buy additional subscriptions integrated TV apps are really poor and provide only FTA channels even after subscriptions. Forcing to rely on individual channel apps like zee 5, Sony LIV, Voot etc with seprate subscriptions  for live TV streaming"
Would recommend anyone buying a 32inch or smaller tv to get a non-smart tv from a good brand like Sony / Samsung / LG and then just buy a Fire tv Stick 3rd gen to make it a smart tv.Since 32inch smart-tv's are usually not that smart enough and have limited applications with no voice control. Fire tv stick solves the problem very economically. Would definitely recommend this product.Note: there have been issues lately with Sony Liv app (not working) on fire tv stick (is the reason that I rated it 4 stars overall)
After using 1 year suddenly fire stick is not working with Sony Tv Amazon replace my stick but same issue with new one... I have 2016 and 2012 model of sony tv but not working on both... First check then buy... And Amazon not refunding my money
First of all I bought this when it was not on sale. So that's a big phatka for me. I bought the latest version thinking it'll be faster than the previous gen firestick but it was quite the other way around. This is really slow. Maybe slower than the 2nd Gen. In short I'm screwed.
"Got it for 3300 Rs. For the price quoted, the quality of the remote is not that great. The buttons on the remote is not smooth. Need to find a separate power socket for connecting fire tv stick. Having to have internet charges on us, just to open and show various apps on our own TV, i personally feel this is too expensive."
"Even though this product firestick is too good, the delivery experience was equally bad. The delivery boy threw the parcel inside the safety door without knocking and there was no lock. Lucky that everything is working fine for now, the delivery service was pathetic."
"I returned this item because the listing stated the deal includes Zee5 & SonyLiv 12 months free subscription where as the actual deal is for FireStick PLUS not just fire stick(3rd Gen), make sure you buy the right product according to your preference. They mislead other offer on different listings which gives you an impression that this comes with the free offers. Never expected this from Amzn.I bought MI Box and it is way better and am happy to pay for services at least they didn't mislead or gave carrot to buy their product based on fake offers."
"I love this so much I said bye to my set top box and hooked up these to both my TVs. Replacing my first gen device with this new unit in the sale. But what is weird is in July, the 3rd gen unit was priced at Rs 2400 (MRP Rs 3999)....and today when I purchased it again it says Rs 2799 (MRP 4999). Was it just to give the illusion of higher discount?Lovely device though! Love it!"
Hi....writing a review after one week...this firestick is awesome...it has converted my normal tv to a smart tv...my son is enjoying the youtube...as of now we r stuck to hou tube most of the time...and netflix m using my broz account...but youtube is overall gud and enough...m using my mobile hotspot...and it runs pretty well...frm morning to evening first day we were continously watching...it consumed 5gb ...since it was a weekend data rollover so i had no issues...i wnt to convey that hotspot also works...so u guys can relax...secondly i also connected my phone mirroring  ..so when my son has his online class i connect my phone on tv screen...so now this issue is also solved...i dont have to buy a desktop which i was planning to.....so guys this 4000thing has solved lots of my issue...so plz go for it...its hd display is awesome...very gud clarity...thanks Amazon...one more thing...my three yr old son gives instuction to Aleza and gets played wht he wants...hehee...
"After like good 3 months, the remote is malfunctioning with important buttons like power, volume and mute buttons not working. After a whole day of troubleshooting the issue is unsolved.Update#2.Amazon helped to get a replacement Remote which stopped working within a month. Contacted Amazon support, they assisted to have the remote reset. Not even a day has passed and the remote stopped working."
Bought it for 2399 on prime day sale. It‚Äôs worth every penny as a streaming device. But the issue starts with the main purpose the motive was to watch free television but due to recent ban on Thop TV the purpose can‚Äôt be fulfilled. Wait for a new app & this thing is ready to rock!Thumbs up Amazon! üëç
"I was using 2nd gen firetv stick purchased in 2018. Its definitely a good upgrade, nit UI, fast processor. I noticed good Internet speed with this one, my old TV stick was most of the time lagging but with same Internet connection new firetv stick is working absolutely fine."
"When I received it earlier, it was not as per seen, found lot of issue related to packaging. So I raised the company this concern to Amazon. After my complaint got call from Amazon executive and he understood my requirements and provided me the replacement with brand new fire stick.Received today morning with company seal, brand new product. Feeling happy. Even the product is working fine and smooth.Thanks Amazon for the happiness."
Got a defective piece. Device when powered on displays the initial fire tv logo followed by animation with sound which abruptly stops with a frozen black screen from which it will never come out. Unfortunately there was no replacement option and hence was to return!
Vol key not working . I'm cheng 2 time but doesn't working..Customer care also not given any good solution. Don't purchase...If interested fire tv then buy another brand ..
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Fire TV stick 3rd is not support in my samsung tv model UA24H4003ARMXL.It show resolution issue .after it screen is black while during show logo.I try many times to fix this issue but not successful.Before buy this products it show this fire tv stick support any tv which have HDMI port."
"Video streaming through fibre optic internet connection is extremely good. Voice recognition and volume control everything is functioning very well. This is one week experience after receiving the stick. But, I feel the rate (Rs.3999/-) is somewhat high. It should be around 3000."
First when i cannect it to my dell monitor screen everything is working good but volume button and mute button don‚Äôt work.I talk to customer service for help but they said that it is only compitable with tv .But i konw the fire tv stick has Bluetooth function then i cannect my sound system with Bluetooth and of course it work well volume button and mute button now works fantastic with no lag.And the best thing is that it always connects automatically.You can go for it if you want to connect it with your monitor.
Bought this firetv stick for my sony non smart led it worked like a charm.I had a chromecast 1st gen for another led however it engages and uses my phone resources. User interface is butter smooth has all the ott apps you will need and more. Has android as backend. Majority of apps and streaming services are compatible. Go for it this is a highly recomended product for non smart led.
The audio is not playing. Video is fine. We have an old LG standard TV. Have informed firestick technical team. They said the matter will be escalated upwards...but no response yet. Waiting.
"Within a month of use, the remote of the firestick stopped functioning. It was very frustrating when we were trying to exchange or submit the grievance. Still, we didn't know how to submit or raise the issue for it."
I'm surprised how seamless the UI transition is and this device handles multiple apps without any lag. I've seen many android smart TVs which failed to impress.In my opinion it's a must have device if you like to binge watch shows on multiple apps.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†This is the best fire stick. Streaming quality is best and it has digital dolby sound quality option as well.OTT platforms are below :HotstarDiscovery +Mx playerAmazon primeVootNetflixZee plusAajtakNDTVHungamaAll these apps available you need buy a subscription. Overall good to buy to convert your normal tv into smart tv. Just wait for any sale you will get it in 2700."
"I have received this product yesterday, I was tried to connect it to my sony bravia TV with HDMI female to male adopter which has come along with the amazon fireTV stick pack, Getting an output error often, I have tried without HDMI adaptor, It was worked fine, Anyway i need the HDMI adaptor since am using wallmount, So today i have purchased a brand new HDMI female to male adopter worth Rs 299. Now FireTV stick working fine with the new adoptor. Why amazon gave me a unsupported adaptor ???, Will they pay for my brand new adaptor..???"
"Cant stream, as soon as it turns on screen starts flickering.Had a talk at length with technical support, return not yet approved, hope i dont lose my money. Fingers crossed."
Stream quality good.. no lagCasting works very smoothThough sometimes it lags to close app or switch app but it's not noticeableI don't use voice recognition because it's crapAlexa Almost just does nothing after every commandit changed our normal tv to smart tv & gave us a common ground enabled us to watch shows as family . I'm contempt
"I am happy with this fire stick. You can convert your tv,monitor, or laptop in to smart.The build quality is good. This is portable and not require more space.Picture and sound quality is good. You will require unlimited internet connection.Good user interface. Alex function is good. Easy to carry while traveling."
ProsThe overall experience with the product has been good with me.1. The remote works really well.2. Alexa integration is good.3. Streaming quality works well.Cons1. Need to connect adapter and TV to different ports and the stick has limitations when connected to usb port on the TV.2. The appstore is very vast but miss on certain most popular apps unlike the Android TV.
"Make your old TV smart with this Amazon fire stick, It just needs an HDMI imput slot. Most of the apps are preloaded Eg. Netflix, Prime Video, Sony Liv, YouTube, Jio TV Airtel xstream, Apple TV, It supports dual band network (2.4ghz, 5ghz) . You can also connect any Bluetooth audio device ( Speaker, Earphones). The remote is built well, give that the only difference from the last generation is the addition of shortcut keys ( Prime Video, Netflix)"
I previously had tata sky binge edition fire tv stick and it was super slow..i closed that one and bought this one..and this one is super fast and very very responsive. firetv stick is the best amongst all other sticks. Fast delivery at my hometown and very good packaging. Plz buy a remote holder for it..its very slippery
The product is not working properly. While trying to return the product the app doesn't allow it. Need to call the customer service. Pathetic customer service and the escalation manager thinks he owns Amazon.
Hi greT device . Great sound great picture. Great interface. I love the neu design of the os and like new remote design. Over all 7 out of 10 as no easy cashe management . But my videoconferencing TV looks  bright than before and sound has improved but vol still little low than previous fire TV stick. At the cost 3999 atheist give 16 gb instead of 8 gb.
so much more functional than the previous gen fire stick..i didn't know how i lived without volume control in fire stick .. TV remote is redundant now.. the app shortcuts also quite useful.. got it for 2899/- in prime sale
"Remote quality is very bad.. it is making noise while using. Regular TV remote is very sturdy.Please use quality material, you are spending so much in advertising, spend a bit of it to build quality remote. Want to return this get replacement"
"Streaming quality is amazing no problem of any kind. Has the option of casting my device. It seems there are quality restrictions on YouTube (some have 1080p but some did not, even though if you check those have that quality option). That's the only point I didn't get. But the device useful to the point that we are not using our dish services anymore."
The product is better than the earlier version. The tv can be switched on using it. Lot of apps are available. Easy to use Alexa to open the apps or YouTube.The tv is now a smart tv after having this device. Would recommend this version.
"All good things about it ,only thing why Amazon left it to customer is total space.Too less for now days and should be minimum 16 GB."
Amazon firetv stick 3rd gen 2021 is really flawless.Depend upon your internet speed it runs quit well.I am having 10mbps speed at my home. Its working well. I main highlight is the user interface its smooth. I wish the inbuilt setting could having be managable while running any app. Beside of this all features are grt.
"Easy to install. Streaming is good, voice alexa control is awesome. I bought it for 3990 while on the next day its available at 3199 . So wait proper for right price before u buy"
"What I liked about the device is very fast.There is no lag,Alexa voice integration is good. The only disadvantage is you have to subscribe for each third party apps.apart from Amazon prime &  Amazon music."
"Easy to install, you normal tv converts into a smart tv, all the ott apps are there.The device could have been more compact and the device should have on/off switch, this could have made the device best in all class."
"I had a doubt whether to buy mi or firestick, but after seeing the build quality, I would say with no doubt, go with this product blindly..Best part is it works well with 5Ghz wifi and can make maximum use of itI bought it from T@T@ Cl*Q stores as they give discount additionally and it was brand new. I got it for 2949.."
"Completely different experience with this fire TV stick, I'm giving 4* because it must have bluetooth speaker connectivity when we connect it with only dextop monitor without CPU there is missing only voice."
This product will make your normal TV a smart TV and you won't need a set top box or anything. You can also use jio TV on it.After using it for a while I have realised that the new FireTV Stick is better than the old one. Alexa controls are better and you can control your TV with it. The steaming quality us good as well. It automatically adjusts the video quality. Overall it is a good product at this deal.
"The software part is flawless, got it in a great deal at 2000. Only drawback and a major one is the remote which is built in China and is of films quality compared to other firestick remotes I have. The firestick is made in India but thr accessories (remote) is made in China."
"I found it better than google devices but it has no option to clean all app cache in one go, limited settings makes it slow over time. You can do one by one which is not easy. Alexa will always play things from Amazon app until you ask her to play from specific app."
"Please do not buy this product, aftet 15 days of purchase no audio. Waste of money"
Converts a normal LED TV with HDMI port to a smart TV. The new 3rd gen interface is much faster and responsive than the previous edition. Supports 1080p FHD streaming. Must go for it without any doubt !Pros :Remote build quality is goodNew remote has Prime Video and Netflix keysSupports dual band 5 GHz WiFi networkHas Dolby Digital Audio1080p 60 fps video streamingScreen mirroring for supported devicesCons :No button to change HDMI sourceDolby Digital Plus won't work if TV doesn't supportOverall an excellent streaming device to convert any old LED TV to Smart TV.
It is the worst product. Hang everytime. Do not  buy this. They made this device for themselves and selling prime video.  garbage device. YouTube always stops. They promote their  business. Worst device.  Do not stearm properly. I recommend that none need to buy this.
"Faulty Remote Control arrived with newly ordered . I received this unit today and felt unhappy to see that its volume and mute key is not working. This is sad part for the quality control of this company. Else I have given 5 star to this product. They are changing price each time, last time I bought for 2499 in oct 2020. It became faulty, I was said that refund will be made. I had purchased this for 3199 and again remote is faulty. But straming quality and interface is better than Mi. Manufacturers should ensure proper quality check"
"I am using this product (with my 42"" SONY Smart TV ) since October 2021. I am very much satisfied with its performance - easy to search channels, very good picture and sound quality and easy to connect with Wifi."
"I am very sorry to say that quality of remote cantrol is wast and too much third class, bad it's cunsumeed battery every 15 days, it's shown that its internal cum technical issue which was face by product and I shall not recommended to any friends and relatives I also used chain fire stick its use very good comper to Amazon fire sticküòûüòñüò©"
"There is nothing to dislike. My standard led TV is converted into a smart TV. This is a smart device. The device automatically detects the TV brand and updates itself and it's remote to be compatible with the TV. I'm able to control it with my TV remote also, without any setting, which means it aslo works with TV remote smoothly.You don't need to use two remotes, only a single remote can control the TV and stick simultaneously."
Poor audio with dolby digital. Whenever inplay song or movies the vocal is too weak and all other sound is very loud. Tried dialog enhance and auto volume ON. But it always turns it off automatically.Otherwise the video quality is good. Interface is good. Needed a dedicated YouTube button for sure.
"Alexa should be more advanced, if I say open YouTube it opens but third party apps doesn't opens while using alexa. Also there should be a button on remote to turn off Fire stick, it doesn't has one, we need to directly turn off from wall plug button."
Amazon Fire Tv Stick (3rd gen) is very nice product and easy to use...Overal Performence is good but Alexa voice search is not good.somettimes alexa did not regnize the actual word what i say through the voice.....1.Picture quality-52.alexa-33.performence-44.gameplay-45.sound-5
not working for my Thomson 32 inch led smart tv. i had tried with TV techinicain also.. he said my tv OS not supporting. But in product discription mention all smart tv's and old tv's also will support. But it failed to support my smart TV. Thats why i am returning my purchased product return to Amazon
"Excellent product! Supports casting from youtube etc., after the laster firmware update.Suggestions:* you can have firetv remote app in you mobile* VLC can be used to play from all local network computers* buy remote cover which is good to have* buy usb jack for firestick to support pen drive, usb bluetooth keyboard etc.,Cons:* fire stick remote is adjusting both tv and bluetooth  speaker volume at the same time and the bluetooth device volume is reduced to 50% and cant be increased further from remote"
"I had been using basic fire tv stick for two years. It worked perfect. Now, I upgraded to this one. It enhanced picture quality as well as fire tv stick response time. On off and volume control buttons on remote are very useful."
"You mentioned that there is a subscription of 3 months but I bought it, so I didn't get 3 months"
The battery in the remote drains heavenly and the Alexa is not good in terms of responsiveness. Last time i got a remote on my previous purchase that remote is good but this remote not happy. This is my second firestick purchase
"This has given another life to my Sony Bravia tv. Now I've removed dishTV and use most of the OTT platforms. For my parents I've installed Kodi TV app and setup JioTV on it.They are also happy with it. 10/10Configured Philips bluetooth speaker volume controls so now I use only one remote for firestick, TV and wireless bluetooth home theater speakers.Never been so simple to use."
"A leading sound bar Zebronics make not added in the fire TV list and hence not able get fire tv  remote volume control possible. Similarly  fire tv stick plug in sound bar HDMI input not working, hence sound dolby atmos performance not possible. Please add Zebronic sound bars in the fire TV list and update"
"Simply just tap next and be ready to watch. Faced an audio issue while setting up the audio device but once all the installation was done. I just restart the Tv, and the audio working fine.Remote Quality is superb."
Everything else is considered very smooth working of the fire TV stick only problem is it is not controlling the TV the remote is not controlling the Panasonic TV so just see before buying which TV do you have
"It is a nice product, though I had a trouble with remote after 6 months of use, however it was under warranty period and new remote was provided free of cost.Streaming amd voice recognition works fantastically. Overall it is good product."
"Price worth product. Especially the Alexa voice control, it simply recognise the voice and it will play. We can download many apps from appstore provided in the stick. No lag nothing smooth move. We can connect Bluetooth device like headphones to the firestick so that we can only hear the sound from the tv without disturbance to others."
"Best Best Best, I got this for just 2099rs/- during prime day sale. I have received the product in very good condition and working perfectly. Will update the review after few months of usage. Note: I have used 2nd generation fire stick for 11months and faced only wifi connectivity issues sometimes, hope in this version all those issues were addressed."
"Great product with easy user interface. Streaming quality is great. Alexa voice remote is very useful. Value for money!üëåüëçSuggested improvements: 1) Please provide a Button for changing the source on TV. 2) Home button and Play button are located very closely. As a result, Home button is pressed frequently, while trying to Play or Pause. 3) Leave sufficient space between buttons. The present arrangement is suitable only for children. 4) Provide dedicated buttons for Disney+Hotstar, YouTube, and Zee5"
"one of the best purchases in recent times,pros- it connects seamlessly and any one can use it.gives very good quality output on LED tvseamless integration of all the apps like sony liv and Netflixcons- I did not find alexa to be working efficiently on my firestick, it will search for theprogram from the app but then you have to navigate using the remote into the appand then the specific program.None the less its a fantastic buy and I would recommend it."
"Close to excellent for the core features of the device. Few cons.... (I) Power button can switch off the TV but it doesn't put fire tv on sleep (II) When fire tv is put to sleep, it doesn't put the display on sleep (III) There could be a way to turn off the recommendations, at least for the apps which are not installed."
"If you are interested in a streaming device and do not require the phone casting options it is a very good product. All important platform are available including Netflix, Disney etc. Streaming quality and device response also very good. Picture quality is HD and crisp."
Alexa Firestick and Echo Dot are an amazing products from Amazon and our kids are enjoying like anything with this Voice recognizing devices..
If you are looking for a great movie experience device. Then dont think further. Go for it...........Easy to setup.Consealed installation.No lag at allUncompromising theater experience (*should have a good sound bar or something else)Easy UIAll the entertainment devices under one controlValue for moneyAnd what else do you want... Go for it pal
"Everything is fine, but only one thing is missing, when i setup with the projector then remot valume 'IR function' is not working. My project brand is 'Bigvue mini Projector' and its not have a brand list name for Valume IR Fuction. Rest is perfect, and thanks to amazon for given a offer of fire stick."
"From the day 1, the remote had problems. Within one month changed batteries two times. Now it's hardly one month, remote stopped working.Even though on purchase they told replacement warranty, it's very difficult to get a replacement."
"Nice qualityHardware part so strong.Fast softwareStreaming level also goodEasy to CONNECTING TV#Customer care services Excellent for Tv set up.U can trust and can buy.After all,  old tv make a  Smart Tv"
If any program is put on hold and restarted it doesn‚Äôt start from where we have left but requires afresh starting
"Amazing thing whenever I tell alexa to put a song or a video on a mentioned app, she immediately puts the song or video without us choosing for her . Streaming is no.1.  It always shows the apps downloaded in the fire TV stick. Such as , Netflix YouTube and some üéÆgame. The TV in our house is Sony and it works well. Definitely go for it."
"Overall good purchase better if you don‚Äôt have a smart tv , considered there lot of apps comparing stock lg or samsung apps , streaming quality is good , voice controls only for prime video , you can‚Äôt voice search instead of type in youtube"
The smartest way to pump up your TV with extra smart features. Got it for Rs.2099 on amazon sale. Additional 5% offer for Amazon Pay Card. Using it as an emulator for retro games as well !!
"Got this at 2700 using my times prime membership ! Worth the upgrade! Better hardware, fancier remote and dedicated buttons for netlix, prime & hotstar ! Mostly the hardware speed made a huge difference!"
"1. Packaging was not very well, crunched at places2. Connecting to wifi was a lot problematic, inspite of having good connectivity and correct password it showed couldn't connect. It was such a painful experience, tried almost everything but didn't work, then the router button process worked3. Streaming quality is excellent, smooth, highly recomended, bought for 2199, absolutely worth it.Will update if any issue appears."
The quality of the product is good. This is a good replacement for you cable TV if you only watch online and if have subscription can see some live shows. Great product for making your normal TV to smart TV. Good for home entertainment.
"Superb product from Amazon.Makes the simple tv smarter and faster to watch various TV channels in form of Apps.Shifting between the app is fast.Alexa search is best and satisfactory.With a good Internet connection and this fire TV , you won‚Äôt require cable tv or DTH connection."
Compared to other streaming devices this seems to be the finest of all. Moreover it is a brand and i am sure that servicing / repairing the device should not be an issue compared to other devices available in the market. This is all in one stop.

"I brought Amazon fire stick 3rd gen on Nov1st 2021 now i am using this the amazon fire stick is working and streaming is also good but after one month exactly my firestick remote is not working, i changed new battery also but eventhough it is not working and my exchange period also expired...Please anyone suggest good idea for repair or replacement of the firestick remote..."
"Voot, Zee5 and Sony Liv was supposed to be free for one year as per the promotional offer. The promotion is not being delivered.  Amazon please resolve this!"
"1)amazon delivery,packaging: 5star2)product: faster than 2nd Gen stick. Wait and see longevity and performance.3)overall : 5star, recommended.If there is any buy-back offer of old prime stick with some discount would be a nice initiative to reduce e-waste."
"It is like getting your Old TV Married to have a complete new Gentleman. It will empower your TV with all the capabilities your TV earlier would not have. Just go for it, Best of Best thing.Not that much hectic to install which you-tuber shows in their video. Just insert and go about with instruction on screen just done.Best thing you are now free from DTH Recharge burden and ultimately your Fire TV Stick will be free in 10 months.Just 1 CON, you need to take care of your cute Remote.We will keep updating once I Use."
"The fire stick is smooth and speed of flipping between apps is faster than before. The remote has all the necessary buttons to make remote operation convenient. Also with this single remote u can operate TV, Fire Stick, Sound bar too. So worth the buy."
"I have VU 2017 model HD ready tv, Have used and tried everything, but the main distinct  feature from fire stick 2  which is volume buttons, is not working.Customer care says it does not support your TV.Before purchasing, Please go through Amazon website wherein they mention which one supported. It's not mentioned in mobile app till now."
Fire TV stick purchased recently on January 2022 after 3 days not working issue is black screen on TV after connecting the fire TV stick many times I disconnected and again connected same issue I'm facing so I'm not satisfied on this product I'm looking for replacement
"The packaging was good. The fire stick is a great way to make your TV into a smart TV. Does work well with older generations of Smart TV's as well. The installation was fast. Bought it from the Prime Sale and is a great value for money product. You will need subscriptions for the apps though, otherwise a great product."
Really a life-changing product when I introduced it to my parents to get them used to online streaming and showsNow it seems like they enjoy the Alexa experience along with a new tv series to binge watch every other day10/10 a solid product
"This products sucks even though its from amazon. Wasted an hour trying to start it for that first time, doesn't work keeps restarting and stuff. It's supposed to be user friendly but it's freaking trash. Plz buy mi box"
"Very useful gadget.the stream quality is soo good. I thought if going for the 2020 model as there is a price difference of 1000 rs,but the remote it self is worthy of the 1000 bucks. Almost all the apps are available.But I bought it for 3300,which was available for 2300 only on Prime day sale."
perfact for my Normal LCD. Thanks for Amazon prime member sale i got it only in 2399. as i m uaing ao mnay subscription fire stick make easy for me to use Hotstar ZEE5 Discovery Sony Liv. Happy with this product.
Very convenient to use plus you can download and use so many apps. You can also do basic internet search. The Fire TV stick essentially meets all my requirements.Sometimes the controls hang. I don't know if it's an app problem or TV stick problem but it's kind of frustrating when it hangs.
"Got this in the Diwali Sale, works fine. No Software or Hardware issues till now.Easy to install and configure. Doesn't feel slow at daily usage but might feel laggy once or twice in a month. It's Something you can go for, as a cheaper option for making your normal TV, a smart TV."
"Am unable to use volume control on my micromax tv, big disappointment for me which was gifted for some one and it is not working in proper way, hope amazon will resolve the problem soon"
"Remote stopped working in just under 90 days. When contacted customer care, I was directed to buy another remote and to return the old one. Once they've received the remote, I was told that refund would be initiated. This is the silliest answer I got. If you're going to replace the remote then why would I need to buy another one. Customer care was not helpful and the answer was very robotic. Very disappointed with amazon service."
"Remote quality is really bad and this is really annoying sometime it works and rest of the time it does not respond . Have tried all the options - changes battery - pressed home button for 10 sec and even three buttons were also pressed for 10 sec as mentioned as per the steps but noting is happening , even tried to remove and reattach the dongle but stull the remote is not working can you please advice how can we replace the remote ."
We are enjoying our new firetv stick. It is absolutely working fine and streaming quality is too good and it is very smooth to run. Very easy user interface. The only problem I cannot still resolve is it's volume control. The volume buttons do not work due to which we have to use our TV remote to control the volume.
"Performs exactly as adverised. Quick to set up. The new remote has dedicated keys for Prime, Netflix making it easy for frequently accessed apps. Device performance is good. No lag and image clarity is great. Excellent value as I bought it on Prime day sale."
This one is really good but the main concern for me is it doesn‚Äôt support Flipkarts MarQ sound bar. The purpose of paying 1k extra to remote is defeated. Hopefully in the next update they‚Äôll add this option. The streaming quality is good and the Alexa response is also good. Would have definitely given 5 star rating if it had the support for MarQ sound bar.
It‚Äôs a good device to buy..If you are getting bored by watching cable TV and u have good wifi connection than you have to definitely buy this instead of Cable. Good stream and  sound quality..and also have all streaming apps..
The fire stick is stuck in the Home Screen after some few updates and I don‚Äôt seem to find and option or help to get it back to view any movies or videos.I would be very happy that the people from Customer services could help me solve the issue or replace the product.
"Smooth and streaming, good TV viewing experience but be ready for data consumption because HD video quality is superb. Alexa is working fine and can add another smart devices with this for operate the divices with voice.  Overall a good experience."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Really Really good for daily use.All OTTs available and downloadable with just a click. My TV becomes a smart TV with this. So so happy to have it and function superbly well."
Amazing. Best in class and price. Shows the true qaulity of the tv and makes the normal led tv ti smart.Super fast and best quality from build to performance.Just go for it without a doubt.
This was the second firestick I ordered for another tv and it has not disappointed. The only issue I have with it is that the volume and the power button don't work perfectly from some angles but I guess that's an issue of the tv (and infrared support) and not the firestick. Happy customer.
"Everything is ok streaming quality is good .some cons. 1. Alexa can't work in YouTube but fire mobile app helps 2. Can't control Bluetooth headphones sound ,have to buy a Bluetooth headset with volume control for adjusting volume.Read some reviews that firestick doesn't work in Sony tvs but it worked smoothly in my case."
Remote is not pairing with Fire stick. Can't use the device.
Amazing product. I have an old LG TV about 11 years old. It worked greatly on that TV and it doesn't feel that it's a non smart tv. I just liked the product too much l. Firstly bought lite version but believe me it's very irritating to sit with two remotes. Otherwise that was also good (similar to this). Highly recommended. The only con is it sometimes fail to load the home page. But it's not a big con (not for me atleast).
Working very good on my 5 yrs old sony bravia tv. Streaming quality is best even on basic broadband plan. You can also connect bluetooth earphones to it and listen through it without disturbing sleeping babies.
"Complete waste of money. Cannot use the subscriptions and many important features are not working properly. No customer care support also.And after writing the review instead of solving the problem, these people are calling me and asking how did I gave such review."
It's third class generation. No third generation. Facing lot issues regarding putting apps like Voot and Star apps. Volume button support. No customer support. Please don't buy.  I M trying to return but not able to. Experience is so bad that it erased all the good exp service i received from Amazon. Get Tataplay Bing better.
"more powerful than the 2nd generation for fast streaming in Full HD. Includes Alexa Voice Remote with power and volume buttons.All-new Alexa Voice Remote (3rd Gen) lets you use your voice to search and launch shows across apps. All-new preset buttons get you to favorite apps quickly. Plus, control power and volume on your TV and soundbar with a single remote.Enjoy Full HD Picture quality and Dolby Atmos Audio."
"i am not happy for charging Rs. 4999 and excluded the promo, whereas product is available for RS. 3999 by other sellers. also it to a week to deliver the product. it is expected that promo should be applied on the MRP - stander discount Offred by Amazon. but overall experience is fantastic, currently the product is available ~Rs. 2880. i strongly recommend to buy, if you want to convert your HD TV to smart TV."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Remote not working. I put in new batteries, tried other batteries as well but no power in remote. Couldn't even set it up. Returni"
"Perfect sealed box, excellent delivery, easy to install. Everything is working perfectly. It can be used for entertainment and learning purposes as it contains popular apps as well Web browser to browse online content from internet. Useful."
"Liked the product, converted my regular TV to a good smart TV. Dedicated buttons for Amazon , Netflix is good. Device is fast, lag free and Alexa is super responsive. Pairs easily with TV infrared allowing volume control and on off functionality."
Ultimate product. There‚Äôs a great difference between 2nd generation and the 3rd generation stick. Worth buying the 3rd generation stick. Great response and streaming. Go for it.
Fire tv 3rd generation is a great product. I have a samsung W80D smart android tv but due old tech it was not working properly with my Wifi connection. But Fire tv resolved that issue like a charm and alexa just adds to the ease of use.
"I am using Micromax led TV without smart feature, For one year I used tata sky binge... I thought I am getting good offer as 250/- per month and quality was also good... But when I explored the price of this product which I got at 55% discount so I immediately purchased and disconnected tata sky binge... I subscribe few application for a year... I must say that this product is value for money...Must recommend..."
"Must buy product for1. OTT lovers.2. Who loves watching regular series.3. Works on HDMI projectors too.4. Supports Miracast/Smart view, It works perfectly for my Samsung M31 android.5. Bluetooth quality is good6. Smart remote is very good, recommend to buy who as alexa enabled remote"
I bought this at 3999 & let than 15 days it comes with 2800 & 3100 with voot zee5 sony live 1 year subscription this is not good  I lost my money& I did ask for subscription then they said it comes with plus variant which don't have any difference with my stick same 3rd genration. with different price so felling cheated by amazone.
"The remote worked exactly for 40 days and they dont accept returns. The remote no longer works, have tried all the troubleshooting tips and resetting it as well. Absolutely defective product that gets passed off as new. The customer service is automated and does not allow you to place even a complaint. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE 4k to blow away."
"After installing application in it, firestick works slow and facing some slow down issues. Need more application for better experience. Please add more application in your further update.Overall experience is very good. I prefer firestick rather than Chromecast. People should buy this product."
I had purchased this product in Dec and has been using quite well and was very much satisfied..all of a sudden one fine the remote stopped working and a replacement remote is costly.. very much disappointed.
Excellent product only con is that its volume buttons don't support my onida TV.
"I do not understand, if one year product replacement is thier , why is amazon cheating.this my second fire stick which I opened after 15 days it's not working.amazon on ur product u are cheating.thats bad."
"I'm not much, into series and OTT. But this device was really worth the money. I have a Samsung HD tv. Please make sure your TV has a HDMI port. The stream quality is good and the remote control is also comfortable to use. No problems so far with software and hardware. The sound quality of the streams are also good. Overall, I'd prefer buying a Firestick than a new Android TV/Smart TV. It was a good investment."
"Really Amazon Fire TV could fire üî• old TV set to smart TV.Remote is not Good. It was giving trouble connecting but I ignored. It could connect even when it was giving warning. Today, Remote is completely Dead. Recently, changed battery thinking that can be the reason. Remote lasted only few months."
I bought this device in October 2021 and its remote is already not working. Pl let me know how to get a replacement in warranty? I have bought another fire tv stick before this. Its remote also has the same problem. I changed its remote too and it got faulty too. So I bought this new tv stick and again the remote is dead. Very bad quality of remote!
"Video quality is good. It works fine not much difference from the earlier version. It started getting disconn6 after a few months of use.Hardware issue, which I didn't face in earlier 2019 model firestick, so I'm returning it.Lot of advertisement popups, which is irritating."
"Product is horribly placed on Amazon, I bought 1 on a special deal, and the battery were burning up on the first day and remote stopoed working. After returning and getting a refund, I tried buying it again amazon does not let me purchase it. I can't purchase it at the same amount, or even without the discount. As it says I've crossed my limit of pieces I can buy. Makes no sense, as I have none. It also means, according to Amazon, I can't own 2 tvs for 2 fire sticks"
Only one single word amazon taking a prestigious entertainment Amazon prime channel on fire stick don't think to much just take a advantage in Dusshera offer best and systamatic firestick in my view amazon giving this  no loss n no profit on this firestickAmazing amazon changes enter entertainment channel good is always good
Very easy to operate and streaming quality is beyond my expectations and full satisfied with  alexa integration n voice commands.. very smooth operation.. its makes ur tv a real smart tv .Happy with the apps .
The power button of the remote stopped working within a few times of use. Amazon customer care executive is asking me to purchase another remote and then they will process the refund. Why on earth cant amazon send a replacement remote as the device is within the warranty!!
"Tried to set up this on three different tv, but none recognized it. Tried all the listed possible solutions on internet, nothing worked.Didn't had option to buy Google chromecast hence opted for this.Beautiful piece of junk. Stay away from this product."
"It works. But sometimes the screen hangs a bit and coming back to normal, even the interface.And the interface looks like a bloatware. Title bar is with Amazon prime suggestions and ads.It would be better if they remove it. I ended up installing a custom interface."
the remote control pisses me offits volume buttons sometimes dosent workits a bummer
It's partially working with firetv app on mobile. And Alexa voice remote is easily pairing with mobile when I tried. But the firestick and it's remote can't detect each other so not able to use.
"It works well with sony bravia smart tv, i prefer to use this fire stick as the speed is good and much more easy to use.. go for it if u have good internet speed and if u dont use dish cable then certainly this stick will be useful to you.."
It‚Äôs good companion if you don‚Äôt have smart tv. I use it with my HD monitor. It gives amazing picture quality and sound. Loving it. I was surprised to see that it goes to sleep only not power off.
It's a nice product it changed my normal tv to a smart tv and I have a lg smart tv but comparing with it fire stick I give 5stars because this is an Android stick. sun nxt you can switch on Dolby Atmos sound the diff of sound is very clear.
"Am using micromax tv, No issues with resolution, Sound quality ease of use etc its top notchBut, the remote I have received doesn't work properly, Volume, Mute, Switch On/Off buttons are not working rest all other buttons are working properly...Not able to figure out where it is remote issue or compatibility issue.Thank you"
"The fire-stick I bought is not working, I have put on the return request around 3 months ago but there is no update regarding it. I tried calling amazon customer care several times but they just put the call on hold and doesn‚Äôt respond again. No one came to pick up the package yet. Kindly arrange the pick up shortly, it is urgent as the product is under warranty and I want replacement of my product earliest."
"Everything is great and many have already reviewed the positives, so not going to do that.However, my requirement would be to add brightness feature. I feel the streaming is 2 shade darker on my Sony TV."
It‚Äôs does perfectly well what it‚Äôs suppose to do :) Just be extra careful with Remote. Because if it‚Äôs gets damage then the remote will cost you as much as new fire TV stick. Hence have given 4 star.
1 year subscriptions should be included when purchased new
"ZEE5 App has bug, sometimes restarts during watching any movie or show.There is also issue in the Alexa voice that does not recognise the words to open a specific task in app;The Alexa is not user friendly as it should be to control the Apps;"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Streaming Voot has issues on fire stick. Even if u exit Voot app, the Video keeps playing automatically in the stick and audio can be heard. If u try to play any other video from any other app like prime, the audio overlaps.While watching movies like Shershah and many others through Prime Video on the Fire stick I am observing flickering and suddenly video stops for 2-5 seconds and screen goes blank."
Remote not working
"Bought this as the first gen fire stick started slowing down after the software update.This one gets the job done. No issues.It alcan also be used to swith on/off, increase/decrease volume of the TV"
"what a product from Amazon, awesome.  Works very well in mobile Hot Spot.  It take very less data, i think while HD streaming it takes one GB in one hour.  This is proactive.  Far Better than a smart TV. Almost all smart TV has Bluetooth Sound bar issue like sound lag/delay etc.  But this fire stick has an instant connection with Sound Bar with Bluetooth connection.  Remote and Alexa is very helpful and easy to use."
I was in suspicion in buying a streaming device for my Projector. After several comparison found Firestick to best in quality and prics.Bragged this unit for 2099 in Amazon Sale.Amazing
Bought this product twice.. but still it was all against my expectations.  There is no pros is I was unable to use this.. it automatically shuts down.. no sound coming as I have 2 HDMI ports.Very disappointing.
"A Must have product if you don't have a Smart TV . You can integrate fire stick to any display / TV with HDMI port .The added advantage is that you can control the media volume with this remote itself.The streaming quality is so good.VFM purchase , I got in Amazon freedom sale for 2799/-"
Purchased my 2nd Firestick 3rd Gen (1st was 2nd Gen stick) in sale... Its the best device in market to make ur old tvs Smart... Very easy to set up... 3rd Gen stick is much better than 2nd Gen.... Quicker response... Faster loading... HD support...
"This 3rd gen remote is good and worth to purchase during sales to get little cheaper.Initially it was not controlling power and volume, but repeated test run for them solves the issue. For me it was 9th attempt, and now my alexa remote has full control on my tv."
"Superb connectivity with my non-smart TV..Converted info full smart TVNow I don‚Äôt need to use my TV remote at all, all controls are taken over by fire TV remote..Worth buying this product instead of buying a new smart tv"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†got a defective piece as the replacement too. Already used fire tv stick its a good product but this time didnt got good."
"Good product. Buy when offers are rolled out by Amazon. If you are lucky, grab a chance to make your TV smart.Look out for attachment with TV unit before purchasing it."
I had purchased this product. But it is not compatible with my tv. I need to return it.assist urgently.i had also spoken to ur custom mer care.someone had called me but due to our festival I cudnt pick up the call.Thank you for your support over the call. An u give me a days time to confirm with my local electronics person if the home can be modified to accommodate fire stick.Please hold the pick up that is scheduled for tomorrow.
A must have product for a dumb tv to be a smart tv well some of the android tv lags because of the function they are meant to do but fire stick doesn't as it is meant to just be used as a media streaming device and the stream quality is also top notch not 4k but 1080p is enough for most of the people and it also supports Dolby Atmos The remote Quality is also good its a Bluetooth remote so it has good connectivity and it has alexa button so voice recognition also works like a charm
Setup was easy and quick. Stick is quite fast and responsive. Remote can control TV power as well. Remote stopped working once but was was able to sort it out quickly  with the help of support team.
The added features of controlling TV volume & On / Off PLUS the ability to install apps makes your smart TV smarter.  And if your TV is Not a smart TV - This is a MUST BUY!
"Great deal I bought it at 2399 ‚Çπ . My tv was converted in to smart TV. After this arrival my family is getting together daily because of tv . Feeling. like a, house is filled with people's. Last two years my tv was not used. But Now my tv gets alived. Thanku Amazon to making my family and tv alive. üôèüôèüôèbut one thing that my tv brand is not in that list so iam using tv remote also"
Its good for live and very low buffering. But the add gives in between is not good. User friendly interface is not to good. I have to find everytime the channel and contains. No favourite or user custom interface. But all over it is good.
"This is a device which transforms most of our regular TV's into smart tv.Useful & effective. Can convert most of our TV's to stream Prime, Netflix, Hotstar, Sony LIV etc."
Nice upgrade with voice and power controls
"Amazon fire stick is one stop solution to change non smart TV üì∫ into a smart TV, provided the TV has a HDMI port. Navigation is smooth and Alexa is fast, quick and accurate. Highly recommended."
The device just keeps in hanging. The screen freezes after 10 mins of usage. I‚Äôve already replaced the device once. Upon contacting customer care they just ask to troubleshoot the device and give steps to factory reset. Then you have to install all apps again and login in each app. After 2-3 days back to square one. Screen keeps on freezing. Pathetic device from amazon.
Restarting in middle of something.Frequently software updates happening in interesting situations.some button are not working after usage of 3 months. Very disappointed with Amazon will this pure build quality.Don't buy it.
Streaming and operation is better than expected. Updated once and quiet happy with software.Remotr calibration is required for volume and tv control.Voice recognition and alexa is ok for indian tone.
"Waste product.... Is does not support sony liv, hotstar app  from  our mobile, if consumes lot of data we watch online shows.... It's better to download and watch from pendrive to tv... Using this fire stick is waste"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Nice Product. My tv (2015 Model) was having Netflix, Prime and Youtuble. Now with this fire stick I can access Hotstar, Sony Liv, Zee5, Voot, Max Player and many more apps easily. Also it supports voice commands with Alexa integrated in this product."
"Internet stick which make tv really smart by addingBluetooth support to pair with headphonesMoreover because of bluetooth for audio, It can be used with old vga monitor just like tv.There are many other features in it which I haven't yet gone through.Value for money product."
"I have Samsung LED bought in 2011, I was afraid if it will work on it.But was really happy as firestick converted my TV into SMART TV.Video streaming quality is awesome and my family is enjoying it"
"Highly recommendedReally I was very surprised after connecting the device with our tv and very nice one, Actually we was planning to change our 42inch non smart tv to smart tv,we came to know about this device, while searching smart tv in Amazon,it's really work well with our LG tv and also I got this device for 2399 offer priceThanks Amazon for this wonderful device"
"Exactly what you'd expect to get. Can't say it an upgrade from the previous gen but still good. Remote is good. Voice command is decent although regional shows can be accessed with voice command as alexa recognizes only English. Considering I bought at a much reduced price during offer period, it's a good purchase."
"Product is good,  but it is not supporting external speakers i bought external bluetooth from amazon, bluetooth is connected to firestick but still the volume buttons are not working its a big mess, everytime need to control volume manually :("
"Common worst features: ""freeze, hang, poor integration with alexa echo dot, doesn't work properly with two echo dot pairs as home theatre, high app load time, ram not sufficient to switch between apps, restart after each of the issues, factory reset after each conversation with customer care and so on..Positive experience : None"
Just awesome picture qualitySmooth operationMore entertainingDolby digital + sounds are greatOver all Amazon products are great
"Awesome device,the new 2021 version is bang for the buck!It is also blazing fast almost instantaneous to touch the audio quality via this is also great,thanks to its Dolby atmos support."
Good product. Works very well on my Panasonic Non-Android LCD TV.No issues so far. Good video and sound quality.YouTube needs to be bit user-friendly as in Android Phone.
I discontinued by DTH connection and got myself Fire TV stick and it not only replaced my DTH experience but provided me with an alternative of buying an Android TV. Had a 720p HD TV (Non-Android) and I just plugged this device into it and got me run along with time... Dont waste hard-earned money into just buying a Television... Buy and Try Fire TV stick first.
Got it 2.4k. I have a smart tv but still you need alexa to download more app and its easy accesability... i like 3rd gen because of its remote feature better than 2nd gen
"Got this in 2499 INR, I don't think anyone would have got it in this price by now, I am happy about it. This is the future of tv, now I'm not going to use dish services. This is amazing product with no connection hassles, no big wires, no visibility as it goes back of your tv, the remote with tv and any of the sound bar controls is only visibility thing. Hd quality and great sound."
"I have the sony 32R412D tv and the fire stick boots upwhen connected but keeps searching for the remote and never finds it. Tried the mentioned remote reset, device reset but no luck.Is the fire stick compatible with sony 32R412D tv or i have return it ?!"
Excellent product... converted non smart led to smart tv...
This is the second Fire TV that I have bought .. and this is much much better than the 1st generation that I had.The Dolby Atmos hooked up to my Bose gives awesome sound ‚Ä¶
"Product works well upto 1year... Then u need to buy new one only... No choice because.... I bought this product for Rs. 2799 in offer after a year my remote stopped working, if you put new battery it will dry in 3 days itself.. so I want to buy new remote.... New remote only cost Rs. 2000... It's a cheating .... Other brand like mi gives cheaper remote..."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†It keeps hanging and stops working. Need replacement immediately. It's just 4 days used and already issues with hardware. Software is updated, yet it keeps hanging and stops working."
All ok. Except no dedicated button for YouTube. And no button to switch to TV channel. One has to use voice command to change input. Rest no other issue
Amazon fire TV stick changed my old lcd tv to smart tv very fast and good I can watch ott contain on my tv the new remote control is very good of Bluetooth technology amazon fire tv stick rocks I recommend fire TV stick to all android user to convert tv in to amazon fire tv stick
It's very easy to use and understand. Easy installation and it put my useless old tv to some good use!!! Thank you amazon. I got it at a great discount during the flash sale. Happy with it!
"Zee5, Netflix app is free for 1 yr but still I am not getting its free. Chinese products and people's means cheating only."
"The Set up is simple. I had read that it may not work with old Sony TVs. I have a 10 year old TV, but it connected with it like a breeze. The direct buttons on the remote are helpful; it saves time of switching from 1 app to another.Got it cheaper during one of the sales, and it has been worth it. Go for it!"
"Like : 1. User friendly 2. HD QualityDislike : 1. Service Provision 2. One of My face the issue of remove no working, and tred to contact service dept, but could not, because of that customer like him are not able to get the ""CUSTOMER'S CARE"" needs imprivement."
"Awesome product. Very good processing speed and smooth app launch and stuff like that. Using it for more than 4 months 0 issues so far. Rating it 5 star. Only for casting games from mobile, I felt a little lag. For Amazon prime video, Netflix and Disney+ and all streaming is like so smooth. Overall excellent streaming experience. üëåüëåüëå"
"After my purchase i tried to install first time on my SONY smart tv [ Model - KLV40W672E ] , after installation i got full blank screen . i tried all steps available online . but no result . then when i checked with amazon support they then they clearly told if its not working then return it . Its really sad they dont have proper support for Fire TV stick"
Undoubtedly the #1 media streaming stick which does everything as advertised. But recently there are ads in the PrimeVideo app that can't be skipped. These ads can be skipped when viewing PrimeVideo on desktop but not when using the Fire TV Stick.
"An excellent fire stick, with all apps available in one platform. Streaming quality is mind blowing. Unbeatable experience of sound and picture quality."
"I have 2 fire stick for my 2 tvs. For one the tv I am using boat speakers connected through aux cable. And for this tv power and volume button of fire stick does not works. Hence I have to use 3 remote . 1 for tv , 1 for speakers 1 for firestick. Overall good experience.Amazon has to work on this problem."
"Fire stick will give you the best picture & audio quality. Its the cheap & best way to watch all ott content including news when compared to set top box or android tv's.Its worth every penny, If you love watching OTT content."
"Disney Hotstar, Jio, Zee5 show unavailable . IS anyone having the same issue I can't seem to download hotstart on my Firestick. Any suggestionEdited21/06/2021Called Customer support they were absolutely amazing to guide me to the process. Now all the apps are working"

¬†Well you could add channels according to the region. There are but it would great of some more are included. Rest everything is perfect. Range, compatibility,"
"The Product i got was in good condition, The Handling and Delivery was also very good üëç.I am fully satisfied with this product and in love with this firetvstick.I highly recommend to buy this product.Thanks Amazon for making such good product ‚ò∫."
Disclaimer- Genuine ReviewFirst of all Thank You to Amazon for this amazing product. The product is good and it is easy to install.  I have already used this product on rent for 1 month so I liked it so thought of ordering my own.  I got this product for ‚Çπ2099 in Prime Day Sale (July 2021).
"I used the device on an already smart tv which had Amazon Prime app and compared the quality of video. While the inbuilt app was average, the devices streaming, sound and video qualitg was top notch.I strongly recommend to have this device as your goto entertainment gizmo."
"received my fire stick on time and everything was fine with it. But all the three subscriptions promised zee5,voot and sony liv, says either its been signed on with a different account or you don't have this subscription. amazon its a rip, if you don't provide those subscription."
It changed the way of our daily entertainment and made my dth obsolete. Though I donot have a broadband but still it gives excellent streams through 4g wifi hotspots.
"I used to use the god damn inbuilt smart TV feature which was extremely slow.Firestick flipped the story. It's fast, convenient and fun to explore. Go for it. It's worth the price"
Finally connected with my projector‚Ä¶  thanks Amazon
"Excellent product overall. Quality streaming, good remote with Alexa incorporated. Reasonable price with a good discount. Quick delivery by Amazon despite Covid 3rd wave going on in India."
All is ok. Old Amazon fire stick have Dolby digital Plus sound platform but in this stick is Missing hope Amazon give these feature vis OTA update. And missing Dolby Atmos sounds features.
I was waiting for it since long time for my secondary  LY TV in bedroom which is not smart TV. Perfectly supports my TV and the remote control works fine with your TV functions as well.
First thing it's showing advertisement on home screen and  it's not acceptable If you pay for the stick and stick shows advertisementStream quality is good but I think cpu it's little bit slow but it's manageable at this price but remote disconnected some time it's a pain to reset the remote
"U can play video games, use internet on ur TV, screen mirroring is so easy, and other casting websites are anyways well organised to use."
Didn't work. Waiting for return pickup and delivery of replacement for past 5 days
"Much better than previous model.However, the price is very volatile. Keeps changing very frequently, which questions the quality or intention to push into market! People bought for higher price would think about purchasing any other product next time..."
"Remote is not getting paired with Fire TV Stick. Customer Service team has suggested to try with Fire TV remote app in mobile, but that also didn't detect the Fire TV Stick.Another problem is that it takes frequent reboot.Why basic checks are not done before packing the products for sell?Replacement is ordered, let's see how it will be !!!"
"Price is too costly Rs.4000 for Fire stick and that to without any subscription channels, if we add another Rs.4000 we will get new TV itself."
It's v v nice productU must have wifi router for better streaming of videos bcz mobile wifi doesn't work betterMust buy product for making ur tv to smart tv
"Killed my expensive TV's speakers when connected first time, bcoz it was full volume sound blast. Not suitable for mobile hotspot connections. High price."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Half discription by Amazon ,lot of compatibility issues, with brand of Tv ,lot of app doesn't responsive like zee5,Liv,Voot in high speed internet alsoIf other options anybody have must try before by this, remote half key work,"
"Facing some issues after a few months1. Hangs while watching a show. Have to restart.2. Has problems connecting with my echo device and playing the audio there. No sound.3. Problems connecting with the internet.4. Alexa does not recognise some tv shows, apps etc. Have to use remote to navigate."
Integration was done quite easily. Streaming is nice . Voice recognition probably would require more practice. Overall experience is very satisfactory.
I am facing an issue with the device from the date I purchased it ..It is consuming my data too much even when it‚Äôs not in use ..It‚Äôs consuming almost 1000 Gb per day..Seems something is abnormal with the device ..Yet to identify it and will be filing a complaint against the same
My Hisense Android led is very slow but fire TV stick 3rd generation is very fast and video clarity is also very nice. Navigation and background is simple awesome.Really loving it.
"Don't buy. Wastage of money. Don't buy any streaming devices which has no Google assistance. It supports Google earth. But not Google app, GooglePlaystore or chrome or other Playstore apps."
"Too disappointed with  the performance of the device. I am using the latest update as of writing this review and the UI is soo slow and unresponsive. Even launching the app section takes a good 5 sec waiting time. switching between apps is also a pain. I bought it for 2400 rs, so cant complaint much. The remote is awesome too"
"Been only 2 months since I bought it and the Remote isnt working now. Don't but! This is second such instance I am facing with firestick remote. , first the remote stopped working and had to buy a remote, then the firestick itself started malfunctioning had to order fresh product again."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†It worked wonderfully from past 1.5months... But now it's stuck at initial loading screen. Tried all the methods to rectify or reset. But it's not working... Now trying to contact Amazon Firestick support team."
Home screen not coming. I have reset 3-4 times but not recovered. Also customer service have not given any suitable reply to resolve the issue üëé
"Beware of fake promises in fire 3 gen,Power button is not working.Volume also not workingRemote quality is not upto markSometime video streaming breakMain UI interface is not customise options"
Pros :Streaming is good.It makes your TV Android TV.Cons:- Batteries drain off after every two weeks- volume buttons stop functioning after six months
"Superb experience and seam less performance, very easy to install. Really enjoying. Remote easily matched to my Sony BD music system. Video and sound quality is also good."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Purchase a fire stick from couple of days getting lots of problems with that and now at everytime this type of error comes on screen and get irritated.This is a sample video because at everytime this happen.This type of error get down the expectations for watching anything on firestick.Please help and get the solution of it."
Response time of remote has improved compared to the previous versions. Improvement in Streaming experience .Typing passwords are still very time consuming. Needs to be more user friendly
Live channel feed does not work properly. ZEE5 live channels are not syncing and customer service is also not able to solve the issue.
"HD Clarity amazing, Sound related it's awesome. We can download the apps from store.I have taken 1 year extended warranty also."
I got it for 4k for 2 pack Gen 3. I am using it for 3 months now and it is like the most used item in my house. In a single day it consumes approx. 10-12 Gb. It just indicates the usability of the fire TV stick (Like 10 hrs per day). SO LOVED IT. Faced no problem till now and I am proud that I made this decision.
Good product. I use this to watch ott content in my monitor and it works like a charm. Only glitch is with alexa integration as the alexa speaker gets repeatedly auto disconnected
Using since last three months.FireTV stick make my TV fully smart.Online content streaming smoothly without any buffering with my 10 MBPS wifi router. Scrollig through voice asistant Remote is very fine amd delightful.also has added feature of casting and connecrion to bluetooth device.Very happy with this product.
"I have updated from Lite to this model, the only difference between the both is volume control access through remote. The remote gets disconnected frequently ."
"Remote stop working within 2-3 days. now I don't know how I will replace or return it.I asked for a return and pick scheduled on 6 march but still after 15 days. no replacement.Although, this firestick is working fine. for now, I am using my phone as remotePlease do needful help."
"Firstly, i was hesitating to buy. But after using it, I loved using it. My family is enjoying and it is very user friendly. You will get theatre effect while seeing Prime movies. I recommend to buy one as u can take every where u want. Now no to cable subscription and yes to Amazon fire tv stick. Made my tv, a smart tv. Getting addicted to it."
The voice & the video quality is definitely improved from the previous generation. Good product to make your simple to an all new smart tv just plug and play...
"FireStick works like a charm when it comes to watching OTT Platforms.It does lag in a couple of places, but I am satisfied with the end product and that‚Äôs what matters the most."
Setup easy and useful. Tried below things.1. Netflix2. Prime3. YouTube4. News channels5. Jio TVLove this remote as this is universal remote with Bluetooth.Note. Can connect bt headphones üéß
"Best way to turn your normal tv into a smart one, works great, Alexa integration is really amazing as well. Anything you need to do just ask Alexa and boom"
"at first I had facing some minor issues like voice typing ,now it's working perfectly fine  I think Amazon should work a little bit on voice assistant on the other apps like aha I spend more my time on aha app but Alexa voice is not working in that app"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Loyal of hangging problem, not working properly, sun next always facing problem after serveral instructions from their thecnical team also not working totally feed up with the product. Only prime and YouTube playing properly"
"Just use of 3 months(bought in October 21,  writing review in January 22), volume buttons stopped working.  So disappointment from amazon product.Better try any other sticks. Even very slow processing. While using AHA OTT UI is strucking much."
"I have no voice controle and remot in tvAfter connecting amazon fire no volume controle in device so I return that deviceSorryPlease improve voice controlIn return many issue no any come for pickup from las 2 days but return satus show package not ready, its careless of pickup man"
Everything is working perfectly fine as discribed.  Its an amazing product from amazon.  I am unable to configure controlling the TV volume from firestick remote.
"Overall experience was great, i loved it very much.But the problem was with quality of remote.No doubt first it looked good, but just within a month its remote started making cracking soundsand its lid became so loose that you wouldn't even notice even if it looses itself."
"My fire tv has synch problem, ott platforms of sony, zee, hotstar  live channels are not coming under live section of remote, i approched to customre care they took system in remote control but they could not solve my problem. Every thing else of live section is ok. But my primary and basic surfing was live watching of chanels on which i am disappointed."

¬†iam past 4 days everyday it was showing some problem Amazon fire TV stick is waste of money dont buy it iam also returning it."
"I have used both Amazon fire stick and Mi stick, but the Amazon Fire are marvelous features and user friendly product."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Their remote is the worst. I have 2 fire sticks. One i bought the first time it launched and then this one. No matter how good the batteries are, they leak after some weeks. And then every other cell inside has the same story. Dont know whats going on and need support"
"Although linked to my same Amazon account, almost 99% of the time voice recognition and Alexa functions were much better than my echo dot 3rd gen speaker (which I absolutely love too) B)"
It is an amazing device to have if you don't have a Smart TV. I got this for 2099/- ( original price was 3999/- ) and hence for me it is a value for money product.
Thanks for the prime day deal.. when I was looking for one got for 2399.. Starting from packaging till streaming everything looks good and working fine without any hiccups.. My best buy of this year
"Very smooth Operating System, No lagging or no delay in response. UI is very cool compare to stock Android. Apple TV support, HDR support in 1080p resolution. I love this remote it is very tiny and cute. Remote build quality is very low if it fall down 2-3 times easily it breaks and YouTube hotkey should have been present instead of Prime music."
overall quality needs improvement. and remote is very delicate. back cover keeps slipping. it gives irritation. why cannot you fix proper back cover for the remote.
I have been using this FireStick for 2 months now and found perfect streaming & crystal clear Audio Video quality.Quality is far better than the Satellite TV HD channels.Only flip is that there is no power off button for FireStick. Only off switch for TV.
Now Amazon Firestick is working fine and satisfied with the product.  Let me use it for some more time which will help me to propogate it to others.  When customer gives NEGATIVE feedback your technical team should contact to resolve the issue.
In my case first boot was annoying as it updated and all but after that it was smooth experience.I even sideloaded jiotv apk and mouse toggle apk.Working fine.
Amazon fire stick has made me to close permanent connection of Tata sky DTH after long time
The zee5 subscription provided as first year free doesn‚Äôt work. ‚ÄúSubscription  is already in use‚Äù. I tried deleting the app and clearing cache memory. Nothing works!!
It's a gem. I disconnected dish TV and enjoying firestick.  + Echo it's even more better
"Smooth and simple UI, better than Android TV sticks which can be laggy sometimes. Turn your old LED into a no nonsense smart tv, voice recognition is great and better than what I've seen on MI android TVs. Fire stick is the best available option right now in 2021 considering all the other android TV sticks are almost an year old and running on android 9.0."
"Product is very good, but it is not working with my Thompson TV. Working with basic HD monitor and my LG 4K monitor. UI is smooth, didn't find any lags. If have 4K TV or monitor and need one then I'll suggest you to buy new gen 4K FireTV stick instead of this. For 1080p/Full HD its great."
Not pairing with remote. Seems to be a common issue for a lot of people who recently bought the product.
"I have a Panasonic semi smart TV in bedroom and some apps like hotstar was not working on it. My US bought Chromecast had stopped working due to region lock so I bought fire stick and it works amazing, worth buying"
"Amazing stick... You can watch all the content of netflix, prime, mx, alt, youtube, voot, zee 5, amazon music. Picture quality is also good on min. Pack of your broadband.For those who frequently watch series on OTT is very cool... Remote is also handy. Slightly small than regular set top box remote.."
Remote ka power and volume kaam nahi kar raha hai. Customer care officer ne check kara or use replace karane ka promise kara. Customer care madam has nice behaviour for customer. Hope k ye jaldi replace ho jayega as she has checked herself. Taken step from her end for replacement.
The volume and some more buttons don‚Äôt work. I guess it‚Äôs not able to work up to its optimum calibre with every smart TV.
"Everything works like a charm, but sometimes while watching it gets restarted. Rest is fine. Bought for 2400‚Çπ on prime day deal."

¬†Fire tv stick not working properly video running suddenly pause and automatically few seconds after play videoAlready i am replace my fire tv stick please try to understand send good quality fire tv stick . it's not a local brand it is famous Amazon brand things pls send branded"
"i had 2017 addition of stick. upgraded to 2021. its really fast. first time when i connected to my fiber wifi. it suck at update and failed/keep restarting. so i connected it to my mobile data and it worked. updated it.using it with receiver. watch my full video at ""anytube firestick 2021"" (search in youtube)."
i purchased this product on oct 2021 and now within 1 month remote is stopped working and i contacted amazon customer care and they recorded my complaint but till now no one contacted me regarding warranty service and i don't know what to do.
"Sony Bravia TV m bhi chalta hai but ensure kare 2 HDMI port hone chahiye, smooth chalta hai remote hang ni hota ,alexa bhi smartly react krti hai, impressed with this product,sale Ane par he le 700-1000 rs save ho jayenge"
"All going superbProduct is awesome, after four month of use now my remote controller is not working now, can amazon customer service resolve the issue??"
On and off keys and volumes keys are not working properly from the day 1......... Please revert....
It was a replacement piece. It stopped working after a day. Now there is no option to contact the support team.
Working very well and streaming is uninterrupted.  Only issue is it does not support USB pen drive connection with suitable cables.
"Improved the experience of using my old model TV, improved wifi connection ,accessibility everything. Highly useful product"
"Works like a charm. Setting it up as a universal remote takes some time and patience, but once done, there are no issues. The quick access keys are an added advantage, however, I would have liked to have at least two of those as customizable."
"I recently purchased this product for my non-smart samsung TV and it works flawlessly with mobile hotspot, JioFi and home Wifi router. The navigation and installation of required Apps are made so user intuitive."
Power off button wasn't working. Also had multiple error while connecting. Stream was okay but sound wasn't that good. Returned.
Anyone planning to buy this please check support forum to confirm that the issue with pairing of the stick with remote is resolved. I tried all official and un official tricks but nothing helped. So returned it promptly.
New launch 2021 Model....3rd generation is good this review after using for 2 month.Little bit price should Come down.
Amazon pushed recent update and device has become so spow that it feels like a decade old device now....no difference in video quality but user experience had degraded after update..... don't update your device
Amazing Product from Amzaon. Perfect fit for my Sony LED TV.  Go for it without any second thought if you have a non smart tv and dont want to spend money on buying NEW TV for you.
I bought this product on sale time . it‚Äôs voice recognition is damaged but we thought it was our pronunciation problem & returnable date got over.. still they replaced it with new product.. really happy with the customer support
"Hangs many time, its plays music in hungama app, but hungama music app is not available for download, only amazone music is available, alexa in 3rd generation is better than old version, only thing worst is slow speedin searching except you tube and hang problems...."
Live becomes easy. Streaming is smooth. Voice recognition is very good. Works like Charm. Highly Recommended
"I Purchased a month back, as i experienced superb quality of Fire TV Stick. And Speed Performance. Picture Quality Excellent as 4K. Nice Product. Thank you Amazon...."
I didn't received product... But customer care team refunded my payment simply. But i got another product after that which is Fire Tv Stick Plus with three OTT app's. And i feeled awesome with it.
I used it to utilise my secondary monitor for entertainment as well when I‚Äôm not using it for work. Pretty decent product. Would appreciate if given more space for storage of apps and also would support large range of apps.
The only problem being faced is that cannot use the power button and the volume control from the Firestick Remote.
It is a plug n Play device for streaming services. The picture and sound quality are excellent as I am using sound bar and sound is very good when watching movies..
Irritating noise everytime switched on. Cable needs to be unplugged for the issue. So everytime it is a nuisance to do this process.
Supporting all function. Gradually We love amazon fire stick.In fact We cut cable tv. Now amazon Fire stick has captured that seat.OVER AL NICE
"The product may be good, but if you have a question, expect 0 support, there is no phone number, no support.In today's world amazon thinks they are too big and giving a support channel to the end user is not their headache is a myth of amazon.I am returning the product"
Wonderfully good.. Fantastic picture quality.. Easy to use ...Thank you Amazon !
"It's an amazing product if you are a tv person.You can watch almost everything on it, if you have Amazon prime account."
"One of My Old TV 50 inchs become too slow, its hang and lag many time, but this one really fast in browsing, it's support most tv channels apps like Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, UFC etc,. and many more..my problems solve now."
Hotstar and SonyLiv app does not get installed in the 3rd generation FireTVStick
"I love this product; I can watch live tv without having a data connection and install almost every app available in the play store.The only this which I am facing issue is with the remote back panel. It seems to be loose, but that's ok because this is an excellent product for any non-Android tv.Trust with Amazon will stay alive"

¬†Stream quality is Good.Alexa Integration is GoodVoice Recognition is very little bit slow."
Whenever i start FireStick It‚Äôs always ask you to connect with wifi. Every time I really tired with this connection issues. I have good wifi connection but it‚Äôs take too much time and running too slow and glitchy.I have 50MBPS plans but don‚Äôt know why firestick have connection issueWaste of moneyPlease don‚Äôt buy
"The damn device dosent turn on with the default adapter at all. Switching to a 3rd party adapter and the device powers on. Seriously who does the quality assurance?Disappointed tbh, requested for a replacement. Let‚Äôs see it passes the 2nd time round‚Ä¶."
Plethora of streaming services available at your fingertips.Streaming quality is great and responsiveness is good. Although positioning of the buttons and the tactile feedback from the button press is a bit lacking.Alexa support limited to very few actions although good voice recognition.
I changed from Airtel Xstreme to fire tv stick. Great product for streaming. Not good for gaming.  Volume control - Not detecting my Philips 2.1 subwoofer.
"Remote back door was loose it is not fitted.Remote voice recognition is not working properly,Remote mic issue.Alaxa cannot hear what I am telling..."
Amazing device. A must have. Alexa as usual is not that great and still in development. Overall it's perfect. The live feature is amazing and can pull out live channels from all ott apps. Remote is great.
Amzon fire tv stick... without any second thought just go for it... you gonna have an amazing streaming experience for sure... best ever...
The product received is excellent and meets my expectations. I would recommend this product to everyone whose TV isn't a Smart TV but would like to use streaming apps like Disney Hotstar.
"Streaming is very easy, alexa works great, dedicated app button in the remote is very very useful."
Quality of sound and picture is good. But as mentioned didn't received any free membership for one year on any of the apps as mentioned in the description. It's truly cheeting
I have purchage this  on 08  july 2021  on payment  of 3999rs after  some  time  I have  purchage  another ‡§´‡§æ‡§Ø‡§∞ stick.  But previous fire  stick not  working  customer care  response not  proper respond.
"This is definitely better than 2nd generation and way smooth while operating, apps starts much faster and a great experience."
"It only works with wifi, you have to purchase ethernet adapter if u want to connect it through lan cable. This is some business by amazon and it is too bad for them that cheap tricks don't get them climb to the top."
"The Fire stick is just awesome..This was my First purchase and totally impressed with the 3rd Gen Fire Stick, streaming quality and sound experience was really great..!!"
Got this for my 10 year old LG LED Tv and it's working well. Had bought refurbished 2nd Gen first but there was some defect in the product and it did not work. Returned and got the 3rd Gen new one and it's working good till now.
"I like this product ,I have normal Led toshiba tv it's almost 8year I purchased ,Amazon stick 3rd gen is having supeb clarity ,very happy with product ,also I thank to you tube which giving correct information abt all products, ThanksAshwin ChandegrahGrace interior"
"Using this with my 9 years old Panasonic 32inch tv. Works like a charm, interface is smooth enough. Got it for ‚Çπ2400 during prime day. Best way to make your tv smart"
"Everything is good but while using firestick power adapter, my tv is turning off and on , so I am using my Samsung adapter"
This is very nice device for streaming ott content.only drawback is its internal storage.streaming quality is awesome.works great with prime video
I got the stick like 2 months ago and suddenly it stops working. I called them and ask for replacement. They refund my money for which I never asked. The main thing is I bought it in offer price which is nearly double now. So Now they want me to buy on new price. So guys please be aware of this kind of fraud.
Spent 4000 rs for 3rd generation Fire tv stick but it's remote can't be paired with my BPL Led TV. Spoke to customer care and got the response that It does not support all the TV models. Feeling disappointed
From few months 3 Gen device is suddenly restart at any point.It is restarting during boot or during watching video or any time.I have tried many things but no issue resolved.My 2 Gen device was working very smooth without any issues.
Amazon why this product selling as a manufacturer defects... Iam not happy of this product...Note: I have prime why delevery more then two days... This is not worth of prime and product totally waste
What a product.I really enjoyed the smart stick‚Ä¶remote works smooth volume control on off is working fine..picture quality is awesome..no need separate WiFi box connection for this I use only mobile hot spot.. speed is so so good no laging problem‚Ä¶worth buy‚Ä¶
"Very nice product..compatible also very easy..just plug and enjoy ur Tv performance...clarity also very good..no lag..kids will love more..in just 2k, your tv will perform smart...."
"It was with a free subscription  of few apps for one year during purchase, but got no free subscription when I start the fire stick."
"Worst product I ever bought, repeated rebooting everytime. Not working. I want replacement or refund"
Quality is very low and product is made in China not made in India.Amazon is making fool of every onePlz dont buy it as it is chinese product.

dosent work properly . gets disconnected very frequentely w.ith wifi .tough having a speed of 200mbps on the same room where fire tv is installed .
"More than anything, the connectivity features made my jaw drop. The remote is so versatile to use that I was able to link my tv and my 25 year old Sony home theatre system easily. With a push of a button I can switch on both my tv and the home theatre simultaneously and control the volume as well."
Excellent device... Converted My 8 yr old Sony Full HD TV. I bought this for ‚Çπ 2800 which is a good buy. Loads app faster & have many features.

Nice product. Use it with 5ghz wifi. Streaming quality good. Lack of good media player in app store. Only vlc is available. Not found dlna client app on Amazon store. If someone finds please let me know. Everything else is good
Could not match with old display equipments. Can be used only new technologies. It is good for old people.
Voice recognition not working properly. You search something and results showing something. Shortcut key also not working. It's change auto HDMI selection when u press shortcut key like Amazon and Netflix. That is biggest problem. We need to take tv remote and change hdmi selection manually
"Alexa voice command is not working from the second month... Don't know how to rectify, is there is any warranty for this product ü§î"
Used it for about 1 month and my experience with this is just amazing and I also had a Amazon Fire tv stick gen 2 and it was also very nice and this just better than it..it's a mind blowing product ... GO FOR IT BLINDLY üòÉüòÉ

"It is an amazing device, I would have rated it a five star, but it is not working properly. When I bought it from Amazon, it was working well and I was happy with it, but as the time passed the stream quality became low, and now it is not even working. The fire stick is not taking the commands of the remote anymore, the screen is hanging a lot."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Remote not getting paired"
"This is a good product which helps convert your basic TV to smart TV, even allows you to install apps,, etc. However it would have been great if there was a built-in Chromecast like MI TV stick."
Fire stick worked well for 6 months and post that audio output malfunctioned and stopping working. Reached out to customer care and they said they can't replace it but can be returned for refund. I bought the device for 4k and got only 3199 as refund. I paid 800 extra for a bulletin product and used it for 6 months.
Using from 1st April 2022 till 5th April 2022 and has paired to TV only twice. Tried all trouble shooting methods and none worked. This is a replacement since the first order had the same issue.
I have installed it on sony 24inch led tv but having issue with connectivity with HDMI port it's always show unsupported signal or blank screen but good things is nice smooth navigation and lots more stuff for kids it's work on small jio myfi also but network should be Strong 3 star for purchase
Thank for speedy delivery during lockdown! Really appreciate it !Would have been great if remote had a safety cover too. It isn't available ...
"Poor hardware, software is somewhat acceptable but hardware is very poor. Plzz Amazon use arm Cortex a7x series (arm cortex A75, a 76, etc)For software improvement I suggest to show all apps on home screen, atleast do one thing in UI improvement."
"lots of apps like sony live, voot  etc are not working. there is an option to connect with customer care but you don't receive any calls after entering your number. a lot of official forums are also discussing the same issue.  can go for mi box instead"
"Just awesome, by voice command we view whatever will like or watch whichever program we like. Can access any channels with just a voice command."
I think no other streaming device can match this in this price point.Also you do not need a Smartphone handy like Chromecast .But remember it is not perfect . But in around Rs 2K who complains .
There is so much lag and it hangs up a lot like a budget android phone. Voice search is not accurate and I end up searching most of the things manually.
Pros:1.) Easy installation2.) Having almost all of the major OTT apps3.) Excellent voice recognitionCons:1.) Only major cons i felt is doesnt support android.Overall a good satisfying product..Those who are looking to have a smart tv at a price of 4k can go for this
Like:1. Easy to install2. System does not get hang3. Product quality is not poor like made in china cheap productsImprovement required:1. Voice recoginition needs to improve
Absolutely flawless product from Amazon makes ur ott experience just priceless ..easy to use and user friendly buttons from d remote voice commands also works most of the time..Alexa integration is good..Mist bou product.
I ordered this twice and had to return it both times. It just would recognise its remote.
Your normal tv becomes smart TV with it. It's very useful if you want to save some money to change your TV experience. Voice recognition is not as good as they shows in advertisement. All other things are ok.
Stream quality is bad. Prime video too does not stream efficiently. ALEXA integration is an issue with no voice recognition.
Very nice stick.. but after I purchased it they announced a prime dat deal where the price is reduced a lot...
"Firestick was working fine but has stopped working after 1.5 yrs. Service centre can't repair it, want me to purchase refurbished firestick for 1800rs."
MI box experience is better
Nice product bought this on amazpn sale in 2200 ... Upto that price it okay to buy ... But better than mi nokia motorola stick .. and far better than Chromecast... If sound button is not your priorities than go for normal version not much difference....
"It‚Äôs a magic it made my normal led into a smart led. Tv . I just love it it well synced with my Sony Bravia led . The picture quality is awesome, streaming is also fast. I think it is the best fire stick in the market . Just go for it"
"The best device to turn normal LED to Smart TV. I would definitely recommend this device, bought during the sale. Firestick remote TV can also be operated."
Device is lagging and slow.. remote build quality is not so good. The one I bought from USA was good than this one
"Manufacture defect product delivered by seller. Aug-2021 manufactured fire stick not detecting remote. Firestick box sealed found tampered. Already returned product with defect remark shipped by Seller, Amazon. Very bad service"
"I had airtel xstream, every time it had problems, replaced with this, OH! man what to say what not to say. Guys go for it, u will love it."
"This product can be operated with voice and bluetooth response remote. They also have mobile application for remote. The FireTV had a glitch when I received the first time, and got the good one when Amazon replaced it."
Best gadget I have purchased ever!! Converted my 10 yrs old LCD TV into Smart TV! Running flawlessly.. Fire TV app makes life even easier.. Also I can use my Bose bluetooth headset and speaker with it ! Can't get any better than this!
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†The worst product I have ordered and received from Amazon. The device worked for 1 month and stopped working post that.The black screen with ""FireTV"" logo is stuck forever. It's been 3 days since I'm seeing the same logo and nothing else."
When I ordered this product. 1year subscription free for sum application was mentioned. But I didn't get any. It was allready activated on another account.
The device was going off screen too frequently to even complete setup initially. Amazon replaced the product on its own when reported and now it's working perfectly. Thank you.
"Sounds is very low in all apps we need keep sound very high, when we switch to tv suddenly Sounds gets very loud its very annoying.No solution with Amazon for this issue"
"Not like this product , is not compatible with my tv.Apart from that , after one and half month of purchase, remote of this fire stick creates lot of problems. Now down and selection button is not responding from last one week. I would highly recommend to concern please resolve this issue.Thanks ."
The remote is the problem.Despite of 2 purchases had bitter experience with the remote
It stopped working just after a month. Waste of money don't but it.
Does the job with ease.. able to use it in my old Samsung smart tv which had issues connecting to internet due to the outdated chromecast.. price is a bit higher but a good product to go for..
I was about to sell my TV as it has android kitkat and most of the apps are not supporting. but before selling I want give a last try by adding this fire stick and it worked perfectly.Now no need to buy a new TV. Its a really good option.
I am not able to change input on TV using fire TV remote. May be my incompetence to operate. Otherwise it is a nice product which I got at very good offer price
"It is just amazinggg.. its voice search, alexa integration, picture quality and its cute design.. everything is just fab... And it also works on smart tvs.. mine was smart tv and it works better than tv's own features...üòäüòä"
"Using it for couple of weeks now, and is working great. No lagging, although it might not be as fast as advertised, although in no way it's slow. Hope it will last really long time ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Great!!!2021 alexa working awesome... Rest of the features are five star.....
"It doesn't fit with all TVs, there are some limitations to this product, 3rd generation has some more lagging issues. IMO sorry i dont advise"
The sound doesn‚Äôt work. After switching off several times has worked twice in past month. No helpline to seek assistance as well.Pls help if someone came sharing nos to get this gadget to work
"All it's features works greatly except Dolby Atmos.I couldn't experienced Dolby Atmos... Even it connected directly to LG SP8A Dolby Atmos Soundbar. Remaining all are working good.I don't know why?Any one please, Kindly help me on this issue....."
No buffering delayVery good video qualityAlexa voice recognitionEven Apple TV is there
Crashing device with updates and forcing customernro buy a new one. How come an update stops the device and zero support . No customer service... This is a very bad strategy that Amazon implementing... There is no fix for update device issue from Amazon from more than a year... It is clearly fraud..
"Product very good but live hot key function not proper work..Sony,voot live channels show. But zee5 apps primum channel not sync ..I next time perches butproblem resolve time..."
Remote has stopped working within 1 month. It worked for 30mins after replacing batteries and then again it stopped working
Used for 2 days and hangs in between. U need a super stable internet to run it effectively but still i feel the main problem is of box hang n bring blank screen in between have to restart box. Keep ur cable if u r thinking to replace it with firestick
I got my order n I am very happy with d product.. Thanks for getting this.. Awesome quality n works fab.. Did not know that we can play games too.. my family is super happy with 3rd generation Fire Stick..üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüíùü§©ü•∞ Best shopping experience with Amazon pay later‚ù§Ô∏èüòç thanks for introducing this..
Maybe I need to learn and get more familiar with this thing.. But as far as I've learned till now it's actually a cool device! User Interface can still improve ALOT.
"I got this Fire Stick at a very good price on Prime day sale, for about 2100 rupees, so it was a no-brainer. But if I was getting it for more than 3000 rupees, I'd have happily gone for Xiaomi's 4k Android TV Box as it'd make me future proof as well. All the best!"
Returning the product as the remote not pairing
Unable to pair the remote and fire TV stick
THE FIRE STICK IS NOT PAIRING WITH THE TV. I HAVE TRIED - ALL TROUBLESHOOTINGS - NEW BATTERIES - OTHER TV - BUT STILL I AM NOT ABLE TO PAIR THE FIRESTICK WITH ANY TV. I AM HIGHLY DIS - SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AND ITS A WASTE OF MY MONEY. KINDLY SEND ME ANEW REPLACEMENT OF REFUND ME MY AMOUNT.
"My first ever review on Amazon thou I've bought like a million products, Was using google Chromecast for 8 years of my life finally gave up, took the risk of buying the amazon firestick, close your eyes and purchase it, it will not disappoint you, you may face some setup issue however youtube solves them all"
LIVE TV BUTTON DOES NOT WORK FOR ZEE5 CHANNELS. SOME BUG IN ZEE5 APP. OTHERS OK. STREAMING QUALITY OK AND SMOOTH. NO LAG AT 100MBPS AIRTEL FIBER.
"This product ha made my LCD TV a smart TV, this stick is magic stick, it has more features then a smart TV. Truly amazing.Thanks Amazon"
As my old fire stick was misplaced I purchased this one. It recognised me and connected to my old favourites. I am an 88 year old novice . So I say it is really user-friendly.
Fire Stick is  completely satisfactory product . If you wish to play android content over your screen you can go for it . I will suggest to buy Fire stick 3rd generation as it will control your TV audio and Power control also .
Returned this item due to the Volume control not working. Streaming and Voice quality was good.we purchased this item 4000. But today the item is shown at 3200. We grabbed this opportunity.Will review again with the new item.
I got it within the time limit BUT HDMI port is not fitting in my LG LED tv. I dont know how to use it. I spent 2399/- on this product and this is not waste for me. Finding connector to fix it with tv but connector is not available in market.Can anyone help me to fix it in my LG LED?
"I took firetvstick 3 Rd generation remote is not working I have replaced remote twice no one fixed,please don't buy it.Finally remote not working no body fixed."
Stopped working after 8 months. So if u r looking for something which lasts an year or so avoid it
"Flawless streaming and crystal clear picture makes it very useful, especially for Prime Video & Netflix."
My Kids love it and I am happy that my mobile is free for me to be used.
"Features. After I bought the product , the very next day the price went down by Rs 800"
"The firestick keeps restarting erratically for no reason.Apart from that, it connects to all apps and the video quality is really good.Better than connecting my laptop to TV and streaming videos."
"Disappointed,very disappointed.worst from Amazon.i am nit able to pair fire tv remote with my tv and control volume and Power buttons.my tv is Intex 2018 model and this fire tv stick 3 rd gen is not supported.please mention whick all brands are supporting this."
"Received a used product, the moment I plugged in, a profile by RajeshKumar was already reflecting. Called up customer care and they confirmed this device delivered to you is already used. Pickup was done on Thursday, 10th March 2022 at 10:25 a.m"
"Using this product for close to a year now. Helps make your tv a smart one and helps connect to various apps seemlessly like Aha, Eros, Sony LIV, etc. Only issue is browser does not run as fast as it would in an Android stick."
"I orderd this and it arrived on sunday the 5th, June. After setting up the firestick the tv screen got these vertical lines on it and it is not going away. The tv was working perfectly till the firestick was plugged in. It seems like the firestick has caused this issue."
Worst product quality not tested before shipping to customer. New device volume and power button is not working. Checked online reviews found it's a known issue. Returned the device in two days.
we have sony (chinese) i couldnt find compatible brand. Other button are function well but remote volume is not working...
I have an old LED TV which is non-smart. I was about to buy the new one but then thought of buying Fire stick and it was the best decision. Saved money on the new TV. The interface is smooth and selections are responsive. Happy with the purchace and would recommend the same.
Firestick is best have remote with alexa features.Compare to Google cromecast firestick is much better
Tv stick is not starting and I have recieved another brand product .Please return this product and refund my money.Thanku
best of quality with value for moneymake android your normal tele vision as smart by amazon fire stick
I had used 2nd gen fire stick previously. I had uptadated to this even previous stick working well. I didn't noticed any big difference at performance with this stick.I don't like this new interface as compared to previous one.
The best product. Believe me... I bet u can resist the picture quality u will experience. Awesome clarity. Easy to use/operate and to connect. Remote alsonuser friendly. Value for money. I bought for 2300/- in prime Day sale.Voice recognition sometimes do not accept and fails to execute. But that's OK. U can handuse it.
"Power on off, mute volume control do not work on remote with Smart Tv. For these functions have to use TV remote."
"Got it at great price during festival offers.  Made my old LCD full HD TV a smart TV.  Remote is fantastic.  Understands regional languages efficiently.  Supports Netflix, that's great."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Product is ok but unknown apps is not installing, please fix this issue"
The audio quality is defective. My replacement was not given due to some error. I was informed that I should go to settings and in audio off the Dolby sounds effect which I tried but it still is giving problem. My request please resolve this or give replacement
Works really well.But sometimes takes few minutes to connect to wifi. On some rare cases doesn‚Äôt connect at all.Laggish to one rare occasion. But on this price point acceptable.Happy with my purchase.
Streaming is not so good it takes 2 min to open. And voice quality is good
"Easy to install, Everything in one device, Easy access with Alexa and voice remote, Excellent Pictures & Sound quality.Thanks Amazon."
I have to again and again reboot my wifi router to connect the internet. Bug need to fix. Returning it. My Chromecast is working good than this.
It‚Äôs just what I needed to convert my old LED TV into a smart one. Everyone in my family loves the Alexa integration
Stream quality will be excellent with a good Internet speed.Rest all works perfect till now.Connectivity is very quick.Fully satisfied with the product.
"No support, üëé. Extremely disappointed with product as it stopped working after around 6 months. It just doesn't go beyond the logo. Did everything as per information available on different forums. Not sure about the warranty if any? Any help would be appreciated from Amazon."
This product is great. I never thought that my old small LED can ever be smart but now it is. You would be in love with this Firestick. Thanks Amazon for Prime Days Deal.
"Have been using an older version and decided to go for this after I lost the remote, it is a good upgrade I must say.. Scrolling through has become cleaner, smoother."
if your tv is not android you must purchase this product very easy to install and use with unbelievable quality. kid are enjoying very much their tv.  thanks amazon to this product.
"Easy and hassle free installation. Works well with my VU 32"" Full HD.Bluetooth connectivity works well with F&D Audio system.Alexa works really good."
"Perfect, good replacement of smart TV stock ui.Lag free and quite good sound quality, no streaming issues."
Better than any other stick or cast in the market.  The UI and UX is just too smooth and friendly.  Highly recommendable.
The product is awesome . It has converted our hd ready led tv into a smart tv. Streaming is smooth and alexa voice control is fantastic thing .the kid is very happy with this product. Very user friendly remote . Overall if u have a normal led tv with hdmi port .u just purchase it and convert your tv into a smart one. Thanx amazon .
"This is very good product, i liked everything except it has very major cons,that most popular video app that is Youtube doesn't work properly on it. The YouTube app need improvement or update. I can use all the apps properly but not Youtube"
"Without fire stick, the colours are very good on our LG TV. But with fire stick, the colours are not looking good."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I m trying to start the device but not able to do. Every time when i start the device only fire tv logo comes in after that black screen come. Please tell me what should i do. Should i return the device."
No free apps as was given to understand. Maybe I should have been more careful in interpretation of the description.
Good featuresRemote works greatUsability is goodPerformance became very slow after 5 to 6 months
"Not easy to operate, other applications not installed Amazon fire stick not support android like  Google Play Store, problem is Amazon given applications installed. Android means work applications this one of the dispoint Amazon fire stick"
"Remote is not work in my (Intex LED-3900FHD) TV .  I talked to the customer care, but did not get any help regarding this. I found the main attraction of the product to be the TV remote and the Fire Stick remote together.  Looks like my money wasted."
Remote not proper working
An ingenious piece of technology. But we miss Google Play Store. Still content. Hurray üòç
"No VI movies and app, No Jio tv, No proper live tv app with all Indian tv channels to watch live tv, most of the apps including voot doesn't play full HD, 3rd party apks can't be installed but such apps don't work."
"Remote is not working, and now no customer support from Amazon. Even I purchased membership of all online OTT platform, and now not able to use any of them."
Not much of changes in specs even after 2 years. But good experience with new remote with many additional keys. You can certainly go for it if not planning 4k tv for next 2-3 years
"We have a smart tv, but still had to buy it...as the New apps cannot be downloaded"
Fire stick isn‚Äôt working. I have submitted return request and it‚Äôs still showing picking up time on 13th October. It‚Äôs surprising to me because today is 17th oct and still no one come to me for the return.
Its all fine with this fire stick except that there is no option to control the volume of Bluetooth headphones or speakers. I don't know why amazon has not thought about that option.
"Please add zebronics sound bar zeb 9400 pro in remote control system so I control my sound bar volume from Amazon tv stick remote.All systems are working fine, but zebronics not present in list that's why I give 4 star."
"Everything is good, but the fire tv stick is connected in the back side of my TV even with the Adapter so it is very difficult to use remote."
"Great speed, Great sound, Great InterfaceI wish it also had amazon app to buy products along with zoom, what's app and few other social media apps"
"Product received with broken seal & it did not work, how pathetic is this ? What‚Äôs the use of paying premium to be a prime member??? How do I trust with future deliveries ?"
"The remote battery is draining like anything. One fresh set of battery lasts only a day. This shouldn't be the case, is it problem associated with every remote, someone pls update"
"Can stream any from Ott apps smoothly, alexa integration is good but needs more clarity, how use alexa in day to day life."
getting
"This product is good. Nothing to complain, I can stream any app that I need, Netflix, Prime, Lionsgate Play, Hotstar, Apple TV, Youtube and many more. It also has multiple profile option."
All the features are excellent working in this stick but I am not satisfied within thing that it could not connect with samsung LED TV model UA32FH4003 series. So pls pls check your TV compatibility with this stick before buying.
Volume and power button is not supporting for my TV..... After struggle of multiple hours I decided to give up... Now I have to return it... Very disappointed on this products.. I could have brought the lite version...the Wi-Fi connect also has lot of problems...
Bought it for my parents.Stream quality is fantastic and it is easy to use for them.Only concern is that the volume can't be controlled for Llyod TV (Hence the 4 star rating)Please advise on how to get that feature working.Overall fantastic product.
Faster than previous versionVery smooth to navigateImproved remote quality.
"I got it for 2099 only on prime deal,great deal and very good product for non smart tv, if you are planing to buy, don't thing much ,just buy it."
No matter how hard I tried Volume and Power Button just did not work. So better off with the Lite version.
"Purchased during Prime day. Worked fine for two weeks. Now, few minutes after switching on the device, the colour of streaming video are not coming out proper and are displayed just in red and blue colour only."
"Works quite well, made my non smart tv a smart tv at very basic price.Only problem the volume button doesnt work with all the devices, probably need to change setting or something which i couldnt find."
"Wow, great picture and awesome sound quality"
It is undoubtedly the best streaming device. The alexa integration just makes life so much simpler. Go for it blindly.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†The same ' fire tv ' emblem is repeated again and again. Once it went upto language,  sign in password, net work connecting etc.. again back to the emblem as shown in the video. Remote is not being paired except that time mentioned above. Please guide me . Otherwise I will return it"
The firestick is not working it is not downloading the application and not getting connected with the tv . Software problem in the firestick .I need to replace the item.
Initial impression is quite impressive. Very easy procedure for installing and playing. Everything is good.
Got a 3rd Gen @ Rs 2.5KGood product.
It was a best buy during Amazon festival sale at 2400 rs .no cons or regrets at all ofcourse it's a best buy
I'm already a fire tv customer. Bought this for my second TV in bedroom. Excellent performance. Loved it. Thanks Amazon!!
Jio fibre set top box is far better. Performance isn't really that great. UI is laggy. I am sure this product will be useless in couple of years after updates the way 1st generation's performance deteriorated
"Very useful for me to change my LED TV into smart tv, value for money. i purchased it on Offer. GOOD must buy"
Volume function and power button is not working in remote
It is exceptional. I had regular tv and fire stick has made it smart. So saved lot of money in that sense. Great purchase.Wait for the sale to buy if you can postpone though. As price drops to half
Made on cheap quality plastic comparing with 2nd gen
"Voice recognition is good, cable tv/ tv stick will work one at a time or you have to purchase some hdmi switch."
I did not get remote with this product. Fraud delivery.
"I also own another older generation fire tv stick that has exceptional voice search. capabilities compared to the 3rd gen 2021 fire stick. Sadly no updates till date, its been almost a 6-7 months that I bought this."
It does its job. We have a Panasonic Viera tv and the fire stick fits perfectly to it.I don't have any issues it works as expected and I got it for 2099 on sale.
(+) : I am enjoying streaming and browsing apps  I am casting my mobile on Tv  We can control tv through Alexa enabled devices (-) : we can't adjust sound by single comand through by pressing speach button  I was failed in connecting echo dot speakers as home theatre to tv
Stopped working after few days even after trouble shooting and performing all required steps.
Bought it for 2k during Prime day sale. Absolutely worth every penny. And the alexa integration and voice recognition works very well.
Volume and power button do not work properly with Lloyd lcd tv.Neither alexa is increasing or decreasing the volume not happy with the product.
Very good streaming. High definition picture. Remote response excellent. Happy that I saved money by not purchasing new Android TV.
"It is actually an improved gen. With all new apps, movies n series‚Ä¶ streaming quality is so good with amazing Alexa‚Ä¶"
First time that am totally satisfied with a electronic product cuz my laredy smart smart tv was usless thanks to the old android version fire stick just upgraded my tv now i can stream at hd without any lag
"At first I was confused between MI stick and fire stick. But after purchasing this item all concerns moved away. Great UI and easy to use. Very good audio and picture quality. I haven't any issue till now, smooth operation. The remote is superb with volume and power button which is a plus"
sony bravia lcd 26-inch klv-26bx350 support fire stick?
"I thought of changing TV ,but  once i bought fire stick. Quality of video  i amazing."
Initially it worked well but lagged a bitAfter few days it says home screen is not available told me to restart when i restarted home screen is all blankTotally disappointed
There is lot of lag and issues when you pair the firestick to your Amazon echo..the remote fails to increase the volume on the echo...in simple terms bluetooth integration with speakers is  hopeless
Good Purchase From Amazon. The Fire Stick Is Good and Easy To Operate For Elders Even and Good HD Quality and Faster In Speed. Price is Little High But i Got It on Amazon Sale for 2899/-
I had also used its previous generation Fire TV stick. & that was also good. Only one thing in previous one which was not good. that was its speed which was little bit slow.But it‚Äôs 3rd generation & it‚Äôs really awesome.
"Quality is excellent.stream quality excellent.alexa integration,voice recognition also praiseworthy."
"Fire stick stopped working within 7 months. Can't figure out what went wrong. Each time I switch on the TV, the fire stick logo appears on the TV screen and it remains that way. The home page with the various apps do not appear.Can anyone help here ?"
"I had asked for the replacement and the customer service refused to replace it. Instead asked me to install firetv app on my phone, which is not at all user friendly."
"Free subscription of hotstar, voot , Sonyliv is not activated from date of purchase If u have already subscribed these apps ."
"I have bought this fire stick. But How to apply for zee5, SonyLiv and voot for 1 year subscription with this purchase? As it was mentioned while purchasing."
"This is my 2nd Firestick after 4K Firestick purchased on 2019, I am a Big Fan of the Amazon Fire Stick performance"
"Everything is class about this product. 1st time using a firetv stick. So far, I think it has slight edge over mi stick."
"You can make your TV more entertaining. WebOS doesn't support most of the apps that we currently use. Therefore, I have bought this and it's certainly a worth buying. It fulfills my expectations."
Easy installation and ready to use. Needs good internet connection for streaming well
At time it will hang/ freeze but you gotta restart it and it's fine. Other than that nothing more to mention.Need your tv to be smart ? Get this.
"power off missing , display language is English if it supports Regional language it is  good and more useful for those who  don't know English&hindi"
It really good and the casting is also seem less‚Ä¶ but do note that there are no google play but you can side load any android to app so buy it only if get a deal cuzz I did else look for some google tv supported stick..
Only Con is Alexa becomes non-responsive after lot of  oral queries over YouTube. Then it can be restored after Manual restrart.
"Have purchased  fire tv stick plus during the Amazon prime day before 1 months. They have provided one year free subscription of sony live , zee 5 and voot but not able to connect all of them on tv shows error everytime when open the app. Pls fix it."
"When watching content, the fire tv stick hangs and i need to unplug and plug it. Embarassing infront of my friends. Can you build this thing properly? or can you guys patch this through update?"
Although firetv stick is a good streaming media but it's remote is the worst product I have ever seen. Not working after 1 week. Volume buttons wasn't worked. Amazon selling it at Rs.1999 alone which is another worst thing of it. Think twice before buying it.
"Network connection taking long time, it is main issue in this product, audio output through bluetooth is very low and the vocal audio is very poor, it's gave only Dolby digital only not Atmos audio."
Best option for streaming devices. You can add bluetooth speakers with help of this device. n number of apps and contents available
Remote volume buttons not working..I don't know what I do..also I changed remote battery to (Amazon battery) but still not working.any solution?
TV controls not working . Need replacement
"I am happy with this product, 5 months are over still the performance is awesome no laging issues i found, this stick has casting feature, which i like mostly, those who don't have smart tv but have hdmi port, I would suggest you to buy this product, thanks"

¬†Fire TV stick is good picture quality so good and Bluetooth connectivity good and wifi connectivity is better üòçüòçüòç"
For Rs 3999/- this is a day light robbery and you need to shell an additional 1499/- for an Ethernet adapter. NOT WORTH IT.
Everything is good. Still the Internal memory is only 8 GB for 3rd Gen it should be atleast 32gb or 16gb memory is still 1st generation
"The alexa voice remote allows us to know temperature, population of earth etc, basically all the alexa smart assistant features are there plus you can just say what do you want to watch and it will open that very quickly. It's fast and effective. Definitely recommend it. üëåüèªüëåüèª"
REMOTE IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. On off and Volume control function not working.. Alexa and voice recognition not tried yet.looking for support to resolve the issueStreaming quality is excellent..
Value for money at the price point I purchased.It comes are quite efficient price during the prime day sale..Worth the purchase..
"Even after buying new Amazon fire sticks, the BIRD CHIRPING SOUND IS STILL COMING AS YOU ON THE DEVICE. We have to restart the fire stick to start viewing.I fail to understand why this is happening and NO SOLUTION COMING FROM YOU PEOPLE . Kindly resolve ASAP"
Previously I had 1st gen and after 4 years it didn't work well hence I purchased  this for offer price. It's  amazing. Worth buying it when u get it in offer price.
"It has been a poor purchase. Within hours I‚Äôve bumped into popular streaming/live platforms that are simply not available to use with the firestick, such as Sony Liv, or Voot..I should‚Äôve gone for the chromecast."
Very good product. Easy to install and handle. Stream quality is fantastic.
Alexa cant play live channel from hotstar we need to manually search it i brought this so i could watch live star sport channel

¬†Alexa is very obedientYou can ask anything she will give the reply. Songs, climate, news, temperature or anything.... Other wise she will answer... She don't know"
Very happy with the product. As per my expectations from an Amazon product.
Good to use for 32 inch tv
Firestick is to much better as expected. Smooth functions and streaming is very nice. All things are at best but one thing is disturbing that about remote battery. You need to buy battery charger as it dries very fast. I need to replace it every week. So keep your budget for this additionally.
"Loved the experience, but next update should be worked option on turning bluetooth off. Which can extend battery life."
"Very Disappointed that It does not allow to install apps like Voot, Sony LIV.. This version is not suggestable, infact it restrict your viewing limits than the previous version."
I got this item on great Indian festival for rs 2400.. Now itz been upgraded by it's price becAuse of it's quality.
Turned my normal LCD Samsung TV to a smart TV . Love the speed and clarity . Thanks to Amazon .
I think everyone shoul buy thise. I live in a small city and everyone is scared what if a soap bar comes in it. I also thought the same but i got my product sealed. U all also check if the fire tv stick box is sealed or not. everyone should buy this product
"The week after was Amazon big sale and have lost around 1600rs straight, what a disappointment,"
Worth for Money1) Doly Atoms üíØ2) Good stream quality3) Remote works pretty well with the TV
I bought this device 2 time and both time remote is not getting paired and initial setup stuck and not moving at all. I have a doubt the second they have given me the same device.
Good
"The fire stick I bought few months ago, is not working well, there is interruption while watching on TV, how to escalate complaint,"
Alexa works well. Streaming is upto the mark. Stable high speed net upto 5-10 Mbps is required for smooth performance. One can go for it.
Good for normal tv  but internal memory is not good
"Overall a good purchase BUT Alexa remote is a big problem, battery getting drained in 24 hours of use. Sometimes it stuck and dont work properly. Biggest issue is there is no such warrenty or service available for remote."
It is working fine. I wish remote should more sturdy and bring Amazon Photo to India so that we can sync device like chromecast and google photo.
I guess it's one of the essential item to have if one does not own a smart TV.No compatibility issues.Works awesome.Great product ..
Super smooth performance with easy to use remote. Just the thing you need to get started for all OTT content and non-stop entertainment.
Everything was working fine. But suddenly remote stopped working today. Tried with New batteries as well. Tried resetting it also. But it's not working. Can you please do something about it. Will appreciate that.
Received it in good quality and packing. But the cost is little high. It is usually we can get it for 2599. But bought it for 3k+
I purchased it on 7 th June 2022 with RS-3099.GOOD PRODUCT.
It doesn't workDoesn't work with sony Bravia. It got started I did configuration afterwards it started crashing every 10mins leaving a blank screen. Don't order if you want to use it on sony tv go for some other alternative
Good product for on older tv. But needs extremely fast and unlimited internet for maximum experience.
The move up down back front buttons just keep hanging and now stopped working.....need service or replacement
All working is fine & good as per the specification. Streaming is good and recommend to friends & Family.
After two or three days volume keys stop working my tv is samsung it found that it's samsung except that it's not working I did everything that's  available on you tube but it dosent work I have to carry tv remote for volume function.. so choose wisely
Wifi isn't connecting automatically and taking alot time to connect. It connects sometimes only if we restart the device. sometimes device not at all connecting to internet.
FireStick output signal not recognized in Sony (TV).Ensure your TV model supports FireStick Compatibility for streaming videos suing the device.Now I use this device on my LED monitor and I like it with FireStick.
Good thing is that it make tv smart and disliked the thing is that it is acting little bit slow response. Need more user interface improvement.
Definately LIKEDALEXA JUST NICE...Installing time depends on the inyernet speedWatched and Data gets exaustedGood buy and Use its Genuine
As discounting for offer's does not mean drop application subscription provided with stick
It‚Äôs a great product but the price of 3999 is not justified. Instead I would urge you to wait for the october sale in India where you can easily grab the same item for 2100.DON‚ÄôT fall for this outrageous price of 3999.
"Whenever i attach my firestick to tv it does not respond thn i have to touch the firestick cable  2-3 times so thn it starts responding but it takes a lot of time in adjusting the wire , did not expect i'll receive such defective product from amazon!"
"Nice product, Super build quality and others, I am so impressed this product because I don't have smart TV when I received this product and then connected my LED LG TV 2013 model it was nice work in my TV, So, guys don't hasitate to buy this product it's superb for all LCD and led TV to change smart TV..."
"Bought this on 7.10.2021Tried pairing remote by different methods. None of them worked. showing ""searching for you remote"" always. Many other buyers also have the same complaint."
There should have been a button for YouTube as well similar to other apps on the remote
I really love Amazon Fire TV Stick. There is no alternative to it if you want to make your TV a smart tv with less cost
"It's not recognised for who's having smart TV, or android dth set up box ,No apps pre installed in this fire TV, and access of keyboard not so good"
I had purchased it for ‚Çπ2100 with prime offer and coupon .Pros :1. Crisp clear picture clarity .2. Easy to set up.3. Easyly switch between any apps.4. Works with even slow network speed .No cons as such .Just go for it
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I like it so much and in Samsung TV the hdmi port is back so you may need to take our your tv and then port in the stickAnd the quality is superb unbelievable ‚ò∫Ô∏èThankyou amazon for this nice product ‚ù£Ô∏è"
I am so happy with the fire tv stick now I can easily operate my smart tv by Alexa voice .Alexa quickly recognises my voice.
"Simply superb,I am using this for my panasonic tv, picture clarity superb,go for it"
Very good product. You are getting high quality video and audio when you stream. Recommended to buy. Worth buying.
"Must buy,Got discount on this product ‚Çπ2700/-"
"You will satisfied for sure if you are using non smart TV, works fine even with mobile  hotspot provided you are having sufficient data per day like minimum 5 to 6 GB."
Good but only drawback i feel is the internal storage capacity of the device. Apart from that its just superb.
"I purchased to have seamless basic apps like Sony liv, Discovery, Hotstar nothing can be found. Felt unnecessary prove no live tv. No other details or clarity. Not sure if this item is defective."
"Everything is alright, only Amazon Prime Videos are not working properly and streaming is of poor quality."
"Good choice for old half smart TV‚Äôs and small remote is handy to use with limited buttons. Streaming quality is great and I didn‚Äôt see any lag, crash of the apps so far"
No more issue with device.  Working properly.  To connect WiFi it takes much time.
New buttons are integrated that are very convenient .Great Buy !
Firstly the packaging was not so good .... it could be improved by the seller and the storage space till now in this 3rd gen. model still has 8 gb space which is too low in 2021. Rest of the picture and sound quality is good and works fine....
"Use it for family TV viewing. Very good product, easy to install, and operate. Fully satisfied ."
Amazing device in terms of user experience. But old people may find it difficult to use it. Cannot replace cable in India. Live TV is there but hotstar isn't visible and alexa will not play some hindi/marathi title from desired app.
The device works extremely well with the TV which is a pure LCD screen. Its a good buy if you want to convert your tv to a smart one at a nominal cost.
It hang frequently and reload.. so movie watching experience is not seem less..
"Not working, you're cheating this product, have to replace the product or refund my amount immediately"
"Liked easy switching between Apps, volume keys, one switch control for TV and Soundbar as well"
I ordered it in the month of sep 21 and suddenly it's stop working
One of the finest gadgets one can get in 2021 to convert your old HDMI screens to the latest voice-operated smart TV + full house of entertainment with cool/smart features. Simply go blindly for this one. Bought it for 2399/- bucks #PrimeDay
"i bought the higher value product so that i could use a single remote for my amazon viewing experience. But i still have to use my old TV remote control to adjust volume.otherwise the device was very easy to install and worked well. and most imp, it is very portable."
The product is good but the remote is completely useless after a month it not working properly and you use app to run its your worst decision your phone will hang and even TV also please Fix Remote issue
"The product was quite good although I connected it to my old ""CRT"" t.v it was amazing picture quality and all the features are good finally ""I loved it"" compared to other streeming devices it is good go for it."
I think its worth buying for those who don't have smart tv at home. And the apps are very limited. Kindly make more apps available on Amazon app store so that users can enjoy variety of services. And Home page interface is very fast but it takes time to open the apps
Got it for RS 2099 on prime day deal... Its an innovative product to change normal led tv to a smart one... Well packed and arrived early than mentioned date... Inbuilt alexa provided for voice assistanceüëçüëç
"The all new amazon fire tv stick is amazing. Great build quality,remote feels premium.stream quality is excellent. Alexa voice recognitions works well too. I really liked the new dolby atmos sound quality."
Doesn't work seamlessly. All other devices are able to connect to internet except this.
"Once the fire TV stick is on, the colour logo is loaded half and then disappeared. After then no response in tv only black screen display. plz dont buy üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª"
"This is the error apearing on my screen since morning kindly check this type of errors before delivering the product not able to solve this kind of issues. my internet is not slow at all, i have restart my modem for almost 20 times."
Must buy to convert our TV to an android one...simple steps of install and then u r done..No problems as of now and iam new to this product
Continuously showing looking after updates and then gives the error message
"Hi Amazon Team,I tried enable the subscription for zee5 and SonyLiv today but I'm getting this error. PFA.I aupposed to receive 1 year subscription for my first stick. Please resolve this other wise I will have return the product"
It's okie dokie product. Slow at times. May be its due to just 8 gb ram. Remote should have an option to choose input device.
Amazing product..  worth to buy...  no need to buy smart TVs..  bcs due to low ram configuration it is running poor..  Fire stick full filling the smart TV need
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Storage is bad is only 5 GB not 8GB... please make some improvement in your storage system. üòî"
Remote non functional within one month
"I definitely  liked this, have been using it for 6 months now. Stream quality, regular updates, alexa voice recognition , just plugin and njpy it with your family"
"Works as advertised, connected to my pretty old TV, initial set up took time but once done everything is working as it should."
Worth to buy. Good response to the remote and fire tv mobile app. Voice search is very good
Simple an awesome product. The viewing experience has gone up multifold after this purchase.
Even after seeing 1000 of movies it works fantastic worth the money for more than 2 years
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†When i received product and try to start in my sony tv..fire stick is not working. Then I tried to replace the same..but no option for replace...only refund..now i want to repurchase the same...price is so hike....üò™"
3rd generation fire stick is quite good. And simply go for it. My TV has smart TV now. Don't think of 4th generation and no difference in both of them. So don't hesitate to buy this.100% worthy product.
I have been using this product for almost 3 months now and yes it was indeed a good purchase. We can play any OTT platform here.Very Satisfiedüòäüòä
Mute button just doesn't work.Volume up down has way too many steps. It takes so much time to reduce or increase volume.8GB is way too less. Should have either given USB port or other option to use my own storage.
A must have if you have a non smart tv and good wifi connection
Though I had a 3 year oly sony smart LED tv . . The configuration becomes outdated with time . . Firestiick gets it bak to unbelievable speed and Chromecast is very useful to cast videos from your phone directly on big screen.  . ‚úåÔ∏è
ProsMy normal tv is like a smart TV now except for Mirror cast feature which is chargeable and reviews say it doesnt work properly.ConsMy remotes Volume button and mute button not working also Power button cannot be turned off.
"Package and product quality excellent..Far better than MI TV Stick..u need good internet connection,  and it performs great.."
Good product
"Smart option to use on old TV and convert it into Smart TV, need to have good wifi set-up to use it."
Very reasonable to buy! If you‚Äôre planning to buy any kind of integrated smart tv modem then blindly go for it! I‚Äôm using it for 4 months! And still counting. No issues happend till this time. It won‚Äôt happen also. I heartfully believe in amazon.
Powerful processorFast user interfaceBest qualitySound quality is best in class
"the devuce is super smooth and amazing user friendly interface ,very easy to navigate,such a master piece"
"Device kept rebooting.I tried the latest firmware and resetting it multiple times,yet it failed to work. Returned the product for the same reason"
"Volume,mute & power buttons dont work, tried to update..but it would not. Applied for return"
I love that it makes TV smart one and make the life easier.Avery interesting piece which I was looking for long is Bluetooth connectivity and Niw I can watch tv using my headphone without disturbing other‚Ä¶Loved it
Outstanding Quality. My non smart TV now turns into fully smart TV. Really superb Quality and excellent features inside. I am so happy to have it. It's really worth to buy and let enjoy youtube etc. On your TV
I like this so much..it works like a charm.It turns your old normal led tv just like an android tv.Interface is also good and neat.
Had to return it because i bought smart Tv hence don‚Äôt need it
Worth for Rs 2300. Excellent performance. If you have strong internet connection go for it. Crisp and Clear HD quality. But the only problem is that only 5 gb is available for users out of 8GB. So not able to store more than 3 movies at a time
This is an upgrade from my 2018 firestick. Very happy and satisfied.
Remort are not working... Very tired to connect fire tv to tv.. don't buy... This is not good product.. remote volume buttons are not working..
TV controls(volume/power on off)don‚Äôt work with fire stick and neither is there any way to troubleshoot‚Ä¶would‚Äôve been better to buy the Lite version
Accessing the Camera on other devices is not working properly. The main purpose to buy this product met. Also getting frequent network error in the system.
I like it but ott subscription should be free for one year
Works perfectly on my old tv 2011 version....and also i got this for 2400..simply owsum
It's working well on my other tv but not working properly with Sony tv only video no audio üòëEdit:- Bought a hdmi to av convertor and use av cable to connect with tv. Now its working with my Sony TV.üëçüëç
"User interface, stream quality, everything fine but home screen can't show apps when not connected to internet, this time I can't play game or local video, music or picturePls fixed this issue on next update"
Changed my boring Samsung led TV to smart tv.
.Amazon let me know if there is another one available at the same price I purchased for 2999 for the 3rd generation stick
"It worked for few hours. But, now it's showing ""NO SIGNAL"". I've tried everyting including rebooting, unplug & plug both the fire stick and TV several times, still nothing is working and it seems alot of people are facing the issue."
the bluetooth function to connect speakers or headphone is just better than other streaming devices
excellent support by Amazon and quick delivery .My fire stick gen 2 was within warranty and was giving problem . I got this as replacement . Thanks to Amazon customer Suport .
This should not be recommended to any buyers‚Ä¶WASTE OF MONEY‚Ä¶ as the remote stop working within 6 months of buying itSome products sold at Amazon are par below average product‚Ä¶
"When I connect the stick using the HDMI connector cable, the picture flickers for first 10-15 minutes. However, when I connect it directly to the TV HDMI port, it works fine. My TV is close to the wall so I have to use the connector cable. Please help me."
"Changed twice 3rd generation stick..Error got while plungin, connection failed with serverchecking for update checking for update checking for update checking for update checking for update"
"One of the best electronic device I bought it online.. The delivery was on time and the device worked very well with my TV. In fact,  I didn't have to connect the fire stick with any external power source..  The USB port could power it without any hitch.."
When powered ON the Fire Stick is not connecting to WiFi and I've to restart the Firestick everytime.Also the Sound is not coming when powered ON so again I've to restart it...
This device make my normal TV to smart. I m loving it.
"Best product, Hd quality"
During purchasing a tag of 3 months free prime membership was flashing on screen with purchasing of any firestick but after buying and installation no free prime membership provided. Thanks
Awesome Fire stick..Really loved the Alexa integrations works really well..Im very impressed and happy that I ordered this amazing product.
"U can find most of OTT apps. If u are fan of Netflix and Amazon, and had a old tv in ur house go for it."
Fast and easy to use. Super fast than Gen 2 firestick
"First of all, our TV is not on the list. Which belongs to Panorama Company. I tried to add from 'Brand not listed' and it was added but all the buttons are working but Volume Up is not working. What to do now?"
It's best under 2500 I've bought this at 2300 something you should go for it usually takes time to load but when its all done you will face no lag at all and 2 times it does not connect my wifi 6 months of user experienceüëç

I got It For Rs.2099 Best In Class So smooth While Operating Good For Led Tv.No Lag issue.If you have Simple Led Tv And You Planning to Buy A Smart Tv Then Don't Waste Money Just Buy This Fire Stick..It's Worth it...
Very slow process of app opening or anything that we searh on alexa can boost the ram and internal storage at this price. Mi box gives 8 gb internal storage and 2 gb ram as well at this price range.
One word. Cool!Pretty happy. Only wish my regular alexa can change channels without remote.
With Sanyo TV volume controls are not working. Other than that everything things are working smoothly. It's should  add hotsatar instead of Amazon Music.
Good device. But Amazon centric. Quality of sound better in Amazon than other apps.
Alexa works pathetic. Other functions work swiftly.Good buy. Got it around 2.7k in a offer
Non working item delivered the 2nd time
The product is amazing and has seamlessly converted my old TV into a smart TVThe remote and interface could include direct access to other apps like Hotstar
"Very nice device, my TV is now behaving as smart TV. Thanks to Amazon for invention."
Its works smoothly on hotspot of mobile. There  is no need of taking wifi separately.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Sasta rowe bar bar....mengha rowe ek bar....nice product...working beautifully with my old crt tv....just required a few additional items...and some good faith..."
"If ur not ready to upgrade smart TV , best way to get this , what a video quality fab , I have VU tv picture quality super.. thanks Amazon firestick,"
"It‚Äôs smooth, it‚Äôs friendly, it‚Äôs simply superb."

Remote is not getting connected to the streaming device despite multiple attempts
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Volume botton is not working of fire stick"
This is my second fire stick for my second tv. Excellent product overall.
"Working perfectly, streaming quality is awesome. Fast delivery. Easy to setup."
Set was bit complicated but manageable. Product is good & I am satisfied with the overall integration.
"After using it for few days, I will say, it is easy to setup, and use. Nothing to complain about."
Very easy to set up and go.  Streaming is excellent.
"Nothing to say, Amazon products are always good in all means."
Happy that remote works with my bpl smart TV too
"I have an Onida Diamond 32"" LCD TV and the volume control is not working with this remote. Power button and mute button is working but the volume control isn't. The whole reason I bought it over lite version was because of the TV control."
"Connectivity is best, there no to look again for resetting connection when once done. For free TV search on YouTube for Jio TV on fire stick."
Very Good product from Amazon. Other Apps along with Prime Video work very well and without any flaws. Dolby output is also good.
Great product to use normal tv as smart tv. Even better in performance and user experience compare to low and midium budget smart tv. Price is little bit high better to wait for sale to make it value for money product.
i am surprised that after one month remote of fire stick is not working and not getting any support from customer care
Excellent product. It made my normal 10 year old LCD TV new smart tv
Fire TV stick is the best performing streaming device available today in India.
"Issues in remote, not working after six months..."
"You've choice to get yourself entertained in your own ways per your convenience, time and comfort. You can set controls considering kids and elders at home."
"After a few days of use, the charger got defective"
This product is excellent. This small device has eliminated monthly dish or cable tv payments. Superb streaming experience.Thanks to Amazon.
"Fire stick is faulty. Remote is not linking to fire stick from day one and there was no support available from Amazon hence return the product but still pick up has not done by Amazon from last 4 days ,  really a worst service by amazon"
I am verry disappointed from Amazon as I have booked recently fire tv which supposed to get with adaptor but I have recieved only Fire Stick. But there is no USB and adaptor. One of my friends has got all the accessories. But I have not received.
This device is good ..I bought the unit with power on/off & volume buttons but power on off buttons & volume / mute buttons are not working from the very first day.. need a replacement
"Everything runs smoothly once the wifi is connected. However, it takes a lot time to get connected with wifi which is not really impressive. It becomes frustrating when you have to wait for 20-30mins for wifi to get connected."
Fire Stick not Pre - Registed and hence couldnot view the programmes.Amazon  not helping in simple way to register it.
Happy to used .. in second week remote was getting hang it was not working properly...but later I have restart... and it has started working properly  till now...It's awesome...product
Amazon Fire Tv Stick 3rd Generation Is An Awesome Product It's Just Like Fire üî•
Getting horizontal black lines across the screen at times on the fire tv stick 3rd Gen. Received a replacement but it also has the same issue. So finally had to return it as well.
Product is absolutely perfect but the remote doesn't work with tv controls as it shown in the description of product but i can adjust
I installed it in toshiba u50 tv. The audio output from fire stick using YouTube app was bad compared to the audio output from native YouTube app which was provided along with tv.
Works as it says good quality streaming and value for money
Basic Firestik is better as Shortcut Buttons takes some time to launch instead searching app is faster
"friendly navigation and comfort switching ,have all the necessary options to enable"
The volume and mute button is not working from day 1
Good product but batteries of the remote drain too fast
I have bought fire stick 3rd 5 months ago initially I was working fine all of a sudden it started giving problem and it doesn't work at all. I have high expectations on this product but it just disappointed me at last.
"My Fire stick remote is not working and I want an exchange for the same,I am trying to find customer care number but am not able to,i request Amazon to look into the same and do the needful at earliest"
I have received a defective product. After expiry of return period its not working properly.
"Awesome product if your tv isnt android smart, quality of product is premium as well as amazon trust is also there. Great & kudos to amazon for superb product"
"Product is good. Processing speed is also impressive, however amazon can give a better deal by giving free amazon prime subscription for 1 month"
The remote and the loading of the apps is much better now. Only negative miracast supports very few apps compared to Chrome cast.
Utterly useless... N no assistance from Amazon..
The product is wonderful and all apps work perfectly fine. No issues atall. Loved it
"The best TV streaming device available in budget. Especially in this new edition, the remote, hardware, software, picture quality, and sound output, all are top-notch. Voice control and connectivity, both are very nicely integrated."
volume switch not working
Most of the apps were supported and works fine.
A  great product. A must have for those who have fast internet connectivity. Its so easy to use and converts your ordinary TV to a smart one.
great dealgot it for 2099 on prime dayworked properly on 6 year old sony bravia tv but its ui is not so stable and sometime hangs
"Voot not working, unable to play videos on voot, it freezes"
I am amazed with the UI speed and smoothness as compare to any android TV or 2nd of firestick I hope amazon can avail option for exchange the old 2nd gen stick with new so everyone can enjoy the latest one
Oh wow well it great anytime ...Full internet always as fiber use but yourself do size pixel ..Normal movie or HD movie anytime ...
Stream quality is not up to the mark but its still doing the purpose. Overall great experience.
"I m using this from last 3 months , it's goodNet connectivity is great then my tv but sound quality of this fire stick is very low as compared to my TV's original sound , Alexa operates well"
It easies the TV and digital content viewing through Voice commands from a single remote. Make life easy.
It doesn‚Äôt work with Sony TV. Always get stuck at update software and nothing happens afterwards. So if you have Sony TV don‚Äôt buy it or check with your family/friends if it works on your TV before buying it
"Awesome service delivered in less than 24 hours, installation was quick and simple, all apps were streaming with 15 minutes. Could have been despatched in better packing. Overall fully satisfied"
"Every time I switch it on it says remote is not detected, home is also unavailable, not good so far, very unsatisfied for such a good brand name, need to replace it"
Product is good but remote quality disappointed.....
I have started using OTT platforms recently only. It had been a wonderful experience with firestick. Alexa voice recognition is also working really good. I am satisfied with the features and the quality it is providing. Overall it's a worthy product.
Very good quality and easy to handling but why so difference in price it's fluctuate always
"Product is too good but in remote the volume buttons are not working, I didn't expected this type of remote from well reputed brand. more over price is too expensive. Other than this two concerns I am happy with this product."
It's (3rd gen) fulfilled and cancelled to change my tv to Android/smart tv.
its better than previous generation. pairing of remote with TV is easier. UI is much better.
Quality is low. Remote stop working. No option of help and support on amazon website. Worst experience.
Excellent!! The Dolby Digital Plus sometimes doesn't work probably it's not compatible with my Samsung LCD TV despite connected to Sony 5.1 Home Theater.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†was working nice since purchased but since last 2 days it is not working. want to replace"
"Really superb, installation is very simple‚Ä¶ Great product from Amazon, I am very happy , this is the most likely item which i brought from amazonThanks to Amazon"
Stream quality is very good. With Indian english alexa is responding very well. Registration and operating is quite easy and user friendly.
Remote's volume and power bottom not working. Please give extra remote and take this remote
i like tv stick quality its very good working fine easy  to use but i have a suggestion for synchronization of TV remote should be a option it should not have compulsory. otherwise non tech person cant install.
Everything is fine with the same product. Quality is good. 5 star
Cannot download apps.Keeps asking to update country setting !!!!Not found in the whole world wide webStupidest gadget
"I liked the UI and there is no lag in any operations and also I must say Alexa integration is very good, it provides seamless lag free experience than our Android TV. Worth buying."
Several times it closedown after 10 minutes each approximately. After installation of 1 hour with above hurdles no signal comes totally. What shall I do?
Remote not working after 16 days... very bad experience
Products works very well alexa added to remote... This will help ppl to search thing very easily...
Not much cons to mention but connectivity to HDMI is little unstable.Otherwise good product
Item was sold with one year subscription of SONYLIV and VOOT though not getting it.
Have been an user of firestick since last 4 years without any complain. Recently ordered the upgraded version of the same for parents.Wonderful packaging and super smooth installation with remote integration is icing on the cake.
I am using this from last one year. It is fast. Awesome experience. It even works good with mobile data.Recommended!!!
"Streaming‚Äôs shows and accessing apps are good, remote control and paring is too works nice. Can‚Äôt tell more about the Alexa and voice recognition since I haven‚Äôt used it as of now."
"The media could not be loaded.

Good product

Nothing NEW in 2021 3rd Generation but BEST in its Category...Better than Mi Stick.Bought it for 3199/-.
"Very nice product, works really well with alexa commands, stream quality is great even in low connectivity areas inside my house, overall a great buy for sure"
This firestick is simply the best. It gives everything you could ask for. Very pleased with this purchase.
Honestly it's a good stream stick. But problem is like you don't have control to set stream quality to save the data

"Nice product , any one can buy this and convert you normal LCD or LED to smart to save your money"
I am supposed to get a refund for this fire stick and a previously bought one has to be picked up from my house. This was promised to me by your sales representative. If I recall his name was Abhishek. Please do the needful.

Nice Quality it is very much useful for live tv and all other ott Platform
It's a good buy and could install in a fizz. Works fine so far...
Fast and easy interface . Just need to provide remote cover with all other products.
The fire stick stopped working within a few weeks
Very user friendly. Good video stream quality.
Improved a lot from last gen
It's very good Purchase and features and functions wise also Very nice
Best product.Picture quality and sound are best.I am very happy to purchase this product.Good job Amazon.
"Timely delivery, easy setup, good quality!"
Apps are already installed. Bit you have to purchase account
"Its lags a lot when scrolling through the interface, opening apps.Also it shows you Advertisement banners on the home page"
Very nice product to turn ordinary LED TV into a smart TV
"Device not working properly, it's showing black screen after logo, nothing else, simply waste.."
Poor quality and refund process is very very slow.
Excellent & very high quality video and audio
"Hi Amazon,I‚Äôm one of the prime customer but I disappointed by this product. Neither send any person to sort out this issue else replace this item.Eagerly waiting for your response.Regards,MICHEAL"
Product is not working with Sony Briva TV
Needed to replace my mother in law's old fire stick. No issues till date.
The remote is not pairing up with firestick.Tried everything but nothing worked .Finally returning it
Bought this for 2799 during sale. Really worth the price.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Can't able to proceed"
I cant install my firestick on my samsung series3 tv. Please help
Stream quality is nice...but with the remote I find difficulties regarding battery drainage
Easy setting up. Very easy to use. Good streaming quality. Great voice recognition. Extremely happy with my purchase.
"Very good product from amazon, converts your normal tv into smart tv , if your normal or even smart tv has hdmi port you can easily use it . Far better than budget smart tvs which get hang oftens."
3rd generation firetv is step up from last generation no change in hardware but remote control have volume buttons now. With 1 gb ram it works flawless highly recommend
"Beyond its service, the firestick doesn't have any option to adjust picture (like brightness, contrast, sharpness, colour etc.) and sound (like bass, treble, surround etc.) individually, which is its biggest drawback."
Good picture quality and  dolby digital plus sound quality.....
Very good one. Functions very smoothly and fast.
"Display mirroring not functioning, not able to raise replacement request, they will assess on phone about function it seems, horrible fellows sending defective pieces in name of festivals"
The Product is fast and easy to install. Works good with 10mbps speed ..
I am using Sumsung 40 inch LED TV. Its Not a smart TV. previously i am used Fire TV Stick Lite. Really you can see the difference in Audio Sound. the magic of Dolby Atmos even in Normal branded TV's
My old normal tv converted in to android tv and my son loves alexa feature.
Overall okay product. But volume button and powe off button off button won't work.
Best in market. My TV also got YouTube and other apps.. remote ccontainhg vice  search it's very comfortable for searching than other HD TV.s  and my kid fully enjoying.. costumer support also good Thanks amazon.
Remote stopped working within 15days and now can't replace or return.Worst products. Please dont buy it.
Amazon Promised delivery on time. Working fine as expected your non smart tv turned into smart tv. Premium quality remote and smooth operation. You can enjoy various apps in OTT platform.
Amazon must allow an exchange for older Amazon devices which are in working condition. My 2nd Gen FireTV stick is lying useless now..üòí
Previously i used fire tv stick for 3months later I gave it to a friend. i'm using LG smart tv WebOS for week and now I clearly able to see difference between firetv stick video and audio quality. I again brought on prime day sale.
"Phenomenal product, go ahead and buy it ASAP"
The device is great if your tv supports it. It won't work for every tv having hdmi in some case it won't work just like mine.
"Great product, the hdmi extender can be little bit more long, so the bend is smooth/better."
Processing speed is very slow and every now and then it asks for an update. Mi stick can be a good alternative for Amazon Firestick.
Much much better then tata sky binge & airtel super fast speed
Received my Fire TV Stick just a day after I placed the order; packaging was great and installation was seamless. Used it for a whole day and noticed no lags. Very happy with the purchase as of now.
I did not find remote properly working
I bought it for 2499 during the sale.. but even without the offer price of 3999 it's still worthy.. go for it blindly
"However product comes with promise of free subscription of Sony LIV for a year but reality is different, while subscribing, you got to know, your device doesn't comes up with free subscription."
Overall excellent product.software updates can solve the issue related to voice recognition.
A perfect device to convert your non smart tv to a smart tv. Must buy if you want to improve your non smart tv
"Only complain , the volumen bottom does not control my TV"
Quality was good .I dont know where is my remote i just purchased and after 3days my remote was gone. Do have any option or any tracker to find it
"Slim & easy to handle, unlike first generation battery compartment easy to open. Bonus to know it is made in India!"
"Performance is very good,Works well as Speed,no lag"
Quality product easy to use better streaming.
Good one... no issues. As good as chromecast.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Fire tv 2nd generation working on this tvBut issues with 3rd generation fire stickAnd in my tv remote volume up button also not working."
This is an excellent product by Amazon. Gives immense experience of Android TV in just a little cost. Must buy product who are willing to upgrade to Android TV just for the sake of those Android features.
Especially my kids are enjoying. The content quality is really awesome. Good job Amazon. Thanks.
All you need in your TV is HDMI port. Connect this to TV and plug in to power with adapter and you are ready to go. Fire stick acts as WiFi receptor and you can even connect to internet using mobile hotspot.
Product is too good but Alexa integration and voice command not work up to the mark Also you need to depend on tv remote which is wired
"Power button, mute, volume up and down is not working and my tv brand is not listed. My tv brand ia Beltek.How can i fix this? I tried different IR profile different tv but it didn't work"
CONNECT TV WIRELESSLY AND EMNJOY LIVE NEWSMOVIES SPORTS ETC.
"It is fully waste of money, it properly works for ten days, but after that there are many problems have to face from this, so I suggest never buy it."
"I have bought this Item, But I have got a faulty one...It suddenly gets switched off after some time without notice...Sometimes it get MUTED after buffering and need to restart the program.."
"First time user and in love with this device. A lot of customisation possible, was able to download a lot of apps, mirror screening, etc. My TV turned into a smart TV.Alexa needs a little rework. Rest is good"
"setting up with Onida TV was lil bit difficult , rest am enjoying the idiot box in a smart way .. Thank you Amazon"
"Unable to download prime Video on fire TV stick to watch later, so better we can use laptop.not worth to spend on fire stick."
"There is no play store and whenever i download or install 3rd party application or install using downloader there icons comes out blank , if i download 3 or 4 3rd party application it will get hard to recognise which app is opening"
"It's a perfect item, good quality must purchase and it's worth it."
I made my old LED TV to smart TV. Good picture quality and enough sound. I like this cute remote. Nothing to say negative.
Worth it ... Everything s fine bt 1 problem remote control works on my tv bt cannot control to my woofer nor my bluetooth speaker.... If anyone hv any idea plz let me know. For nw 4star

¬†Not working past 2days showing same error"
"Good product, thanks to amazon. I have eliminated my setup box. Till date it is working fine. I can give next round of feedback after 3 month."
"This works only with amazon. This is not suitable for any other apps like SunNxt, Aha video even if you purchase them. I am writing this review after using it for a month."
"Nice fire tv for Amazon prime video, clear vision"
Worst product caught fire whileWatching. Defintly nt safe beware while watching.
"I basically loved the product it's just amazing it's easy device, I mean if you know how to operate a nokia(the original one) u will definitely be able to operate this product. It is very simple and easy to use, so I must say go for it"
"Have used Roku, chromecast prior to fire stick, but fire stick beats them all. Best device to make your TV a smart TV"
Firestick has had too much reviews. Am not gonna say anything new on the product. Its Amazon's service and is worse nowadays than ever and pls don't blame it on covid now. That'll be too low even for you amazon
Stopped working after 3 months.
Hot keys are wonderful for accessing popular apps.
Very friendly usable with lot of application..Alexa is great to access this fire stick
Linking with TV.. We enjoy the presence  of Alexa which is helping us in accessing the required programmes.
"It just works like a charm, can't go wrong with alexa brilliant voice recognition. Stream quality is really good overall pretty happy with the product"
What I realized  after using 10 days .its awesome and very nice  gadget for smart  tv.i really  prescribe for everyone  to purchase this one those who have smart tv .those who are really  interested  to  convert  to  android  tv
Seriously this is my third fire stick. I installed it on my 2 bedroom and in drawing room as well even though all of them are android tv but i love firetv interface
"Easy to install, good strming if you have good internet"
Although I don't think there's a way to recall what you were last watching.
"Awesome device to turn old monitors into stand alone TV's without cpu, cost effective"
It very easy to install. Streaming video quality is very good. Go for it without any confusion. It is easy to use .
Now my TV has become more useful
Everything cool... not taken much time to setup and Quality is awesome

I have observed frequent crashing of fire tv stick while watching programs.One need to power off and restart to resume. Not happy with this product
Remote is not working
Easy and quick to access Apps.
"Good stream quality, best experience. Loved it."
This is good option to convert non smart TV to Smart with upgraded feature. You can not upgrade you TV every 2nd year but you can upgrade TV stick as per new technology.
good
"Everything is fine working but after one month use remote power, volume and mute buttons stopped working I'll go in settings but icant found remote settings so anybody can help me how can I fix it."
The audio is garbled. I have to switch off and on several times before it becomes ok. And this happens every time I access anything through the fire stick. Never happened with the earlier model. VERY disappointed.
No doubt the product is too good. Very good video quality and voice recognition. Good to go with any second thought.
Intentions to use fire TV is fulfilled.Works well. No problem facing to connect my Sony Led TV.Not tested on mobile hotspot but Streaming is good as I have wifi.
Nice streaming device for non smart TV and I loved it

Volume and on off button not supporting to my TV
"I had purchased earlier, I just want to know is it effect my samsung smart tv colour,? Becouse when I use my Tv colour becomes fade and repairs two time ..Pls advise should I attached it or not"
Not much good. Hangs multiple time alexa won't work some times. Earlier version was far better than thisUI is also not user friendly
Really good quality streaming and assistance...
"Very nice product , picture quality is amazing , fast no lagging issue, but one thing I don't like of this device is voice quality issue , it's not  up to the mark"
Not able to connect broad band. Even replacement was done. Still waiting for refund. Worst experience and totally making fool.

I have 2 TVs in my house.One is latest android TV and another one is 12 years old LCD TV.Firetv stick is working so nicely with my 12 years old LCD TV. Purpose served
It's having small problem. First when we on it... It's giving different sounds and voice is not audible. Hence need to do power off and on again. Every time need to do this process.
Software needs to be updated ..dolby atmos is not supported and dolby pass through is available..
"Worst product, live channels from zee5 and hotstar not syncing although i have subscription. What is the use . Total waste of money."
Good Product!
"It's fantasticü§òüòùü§ò, it changes the tv experience. No more waiting for shows to telecast, I can view the shows, movies, news and many more at my convenient time. Go for it guys.."

Overall a beautiful product. It really enhances the user experience if the TV is not smart. Am happy till now . Have been using since last 2-3 months. Alexa feature is wonderful.
I bought fire stick along with yearly subscriptions of zee 5 voot Sony live.On trying to register non of these actually get registered.Has Amazon resorted to cheating and false promises?
I used it for a monitor and it works very well no time lapse when streaming. Picture quality app storage excellent. It wa irks like a super smart tv.
"Quick and easy to setup, works as tv remote too ( eArc HDMI port only )No lagging with wifi 4g and 5g.Quick startup ( 5 sec )"
After using of one month I found that the fire stick is fantastic and too fast.
Very Good Product but need more should download free
"Alexa cannot understand other languages than english when said to play bengali songs from amazon music, and the volume button on the remote is not working at all !"
Easy to use fulfils the purpose and excellent quality.
Asked for a compatible cable with USB port equal to that of Pen Drive as your Fire Stick has bigger pin and my HDMI has pen drive size port.
Cheap way to transform the standard TV to smart TV set.
It's just awesome and voice remote is very good.. Impressed with alexa ...wanted to buy more advanced Alexa in smart hime thank you amazon üî•üî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The fire stick is easy to understand and use. The Alexa integration is the best part in it as it detects the voice perfectly. Great quality and would recommend others to buy also.
Bad product now don't see an option to replace....
The interface is quite similar to android and easy to use.It is quite fast to browse.. Alexa needs some more work.overall a pretty good purchase.
Device not responding to remote properly. It lags a lot.
Superrrrrr.....Worth for money.We have been now using it since 2 months and entire family is enjoying it a lot. Thanks Amazon !!
Product is nice but Alex needs more refinement.
It's a good product and suits for all TV with 4k... Only disappointment was after I purchased Amazon launched the offer and it was less 2000/- ... From the price which I purchased.
Must buy who wants to convert regular tv into smart tv... without doubt go for it
Seriously bad product remote works for a few months. Stoped working after 6 months.. Anyone know warrenty?
"It always stop working after some time. TV screen goes blank. To continue work, either remove and re insert the device or re startthe TV."
"Nice and tiny yet very powerful product to convert your normal TV to a smart one. Very fast handling time, quick delivery, smart packaging. Overall value for money!!"

"I AM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED THAT MY FIRETV IS NOT WORKING.@AMAZON I KNOW YOU GUYS WILL NOT CONTACT , IF IT COMES TO YOUR PRODUCT YOU GUYS ARE MORE CARELESS AT TIMES."
The Power and Volume buttons on the remote have stopped working within 2 months. Very disappointing.
I have 2 firestickInstalling both in 2 different room creat interface and my 3rd generation first is is creating some kind of technical glich for my 1st generation
Finally i able to distracted my dad from my shadi topic. Now he is busy watching online  movies n videos n m in relief üòÖ
Sometimes it behaves erroneously. Keeps screen moving automatically. Have to switch off for sometime for firestick to act properly.
Wel done AmazonThank U üíê
Having lag 5 to 10 minutes after starting the device
Very good product. Works as advertised
Works perfectly like a smart tv on an old LCD tv. Features are good
Good
Product is fine but received a faulty adapter
In my tv tv controls like poweroff and volume isn't working I tried every way but it is not working
Recommended for those who have wifi connection and old led tv. It works.
Good experience using this one!
Volume button stopped working. Theres no customer service or warranty
"Free 1 year subscription for apps like voot ,zee 5 ,and sonyliv which was promised is not working which was a huge upset hope Amazon can figure it out. Other than that fire TV stick is  great ."
"At the time of purchase, telling discovery+, sony, and more apps are free üÜì with this pack. But not able to login"
"Iam using a Sony Bravia 40 inch,in addition to the stick not working,it also made my tv to restart repeatedly.now my tv needs to be repaired.too muah for smart tv experience ü§¶ü§¶"
What can we say much than the description itself easy to use and seamless inetegratio with Alexa. New UI looks much cooler.
Streaming quality is top notch sound out put is also very good no lagg nothing works good on mobile hotspot also10/10 product must hv productGot best deal on prime day saleüòÅ 2100only
"Does not make any sense to give the review on return product,please fix the bug."
Alexa integration is very poor in this device. You should rather buy a smart TV than to buy fire tv stick.
Received a damaged box but no damage to the product. The streaming quality is good. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy it. And I bought it for Rs.3200 which is a great deal.
Some time it lags in booting and load the apps. But when booted completely it works good.
Perfect
Excellent üëåüëå product but high price and internal storage could have at least 10gb.
It‚Äôs really a nice product to have if you have good interest connection. Work like a charm.
Value for Money. Worth to invest once rather than subscribing through TATASKY by paying more.
This is realy awesome 10 out of 10. It meets all my needs. Thank You Amazone.. üòäüòäüòä
Best streaming device. It is so convenient with remote. Only issue is remote is very expensive in case it gets damaged or lost.
Good product to make your normal TV to Smart Android TV. Watch all free contents from your favourite apps.
"Bought this product during the prime day sale at a steal deal, the entertainment content available online is great and it help you steam all of that on your old non smart tv. Best purchase so fare,"
Video Quality and sound i give 5 stars.
"The product is good,but Alexa needs a quiet lot improvement cauz u gotta say couple of times before Alexa can understand.üòî"
But good job.Replacement remote is too costly
"Happy after using for 20 days , It should have youtube button which is used mostly"
Picture superVoice recognisation also ok but not receiving telugu language properlyExcept this all feautres are Excellent
The only reason I purchased the remote is for its volume control feature and it is not working.

"Little slow to respond as compared to smart tvs. At first it always freeze up in between of stream after sometime only, but after calling customer service and installing the updates, issues is now resolved."
"The remote having an issues that within 6Month from date of purchase, the battery is draining faster within One day even with new batteries has been replaced with 3 sets."
Very much disappointed.‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏èIts getting turn OFF during watching suddenly and audio is not getting. Its volume is in mute mode. It‚Äôs not working properly.Utter flop experience.
Easy set up and very nice connectivity. Excellent stream quality.
Always the best
Very costly
Fire TV is good all over.Just for the sake of direct buttons on remote not to go for 3999/- but one can choose 2999/- one
Audio quality is very impressive and it streams video based on internet Speed is an advantage of using it

Post Covid this is a must have .. as we spend a ton of time indoors .. Made a huge difference in my aged parents lives who are stuck indoors !!
Great product to enhance your led tv to smart tv
Streaming quality not good
"Screen freezes up continuosly... And sound to the alexa echo speakers keeps cutting off.. if these can be fixed, it's an awesome product, but for now, it's not recommended"
Great experience
i have installed the fire tv stick. iam able to watch various OTT s . But the on/off button and the volume control buttons of the fire tv remote are not working. How to rectify that?
Must product to have in your house.
Its a nice gadget that turned my 9 year old lcd tv to a smart tv.. Uses almost 1.5 gb data to watch a movie in prime but in good quality
"Works fine, Price dropped by 1100 in few days after purchase"
"Exactly one month it worked. After that it stoped. No warranty, not even a number to contact for replacement."
Excellent product
There‚Äôs a issue with connectivity of Bluetooth.It gives very low audio output to soundboard through Bluetooth.Called Amazon and have been told that this issue will get fixed soon.
"If ur internet speed is between 30-100 mbps this firestick is more than enough, streamin quality is top notch, the setup takes sometimes but once done you are all set"
Great ProducSmooth and value for moneyStreaming at 1080p not lagging
I purchased 3rd generation kit but i returned it very soon because volume keys and on/off keys were not working on that time...so my experience was not good with this
"Everything is good apart from tv remote quality. it could have been built better. Nonetheless, it just works fine. Highly Recommended."
Make my Led tv a smart tv. Runs smoothly. Interface is good.
Go for it with out other thought
"I just to say Iove It. My child was so happy and many time said thank you to me, for purchased wonderful Fire Stick product. Thank you Amazon."
The product was of good quality but the extender wire is small and the alexa remote recognition is poor. Otherwise product is very useful and of superior quality.
The product is very nice. It gives wings to my old style LED. The best thing is customer care support provided by Amazon. After it no one will get bored anymore.
Its only been 3 months and remote is not working its terrible. I spent a lot of money on this and its for 3 months only
"Great streaming quality,user friendly interface, excellent voice recognition and it has many different apps."
Now Product is not working. Its Hangup after 5 minuPlease let me know how it will be replaced
"best for non android TV,"
Dolby Atmos is only Marketing Gimmick....Only support Dolby digital plus....Wifi connection issue is there every time you switch on the firestick....Not a worthy Product
The remote is not functioning well... Volume and few buttons are not working from beginning.. Expect the quality check to be done before goods are sent to the customer.
No feedback calls from the company very cheap services üòî the remote volume button is not working very disappointed...
It‚Äôs not working with Micromax tv and no service support  If you want after sales support you have to spend to and return courier charges
"New generation fire tv stick, loved the interface, got it for 2099/- more worth than the listed price"
Very good and snappy device . I bought it especially so I can calibrate the display via my remote . Overall it's a good product for a old or secondary TV.
"May be defective product, not working properly"
Iam using  1st day picture quality above average sound quality is good streaming quality is good
Very fast streaming device
Good Gadget for a Normal TV. Only thing we can say as Con is we need most of the app subscription to access that apps.
Every thing is just good. Had issues with Bt sound. But with version 5 issue is resolved
I own a 2nd Gen Fire Stick. I have upgraded it for getting Dolby Atmos. But Dolby Atmos is not working with my Zebrobics Zeb Juke Bar-3850 Soundbar. I am disappointed.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Excellent,,,,,nice ....feeling very happy ...."
Storage should be more around 16 GB.Third party app icon should show and alexa should also work on third party app.
Using it with my Panasonic HD ready LED .Perfect connectivity with HD quality picture . Really a very nice initiative from Amazon .
"I love it, except the remote doesn't work in increasing or decreasing the volume in the apps. Don't know why"
"The stream quality, voice recognition and alexa integration works great"
This product has poor wifi support. You will get irritated if wifi router is in next room.It takes 5-10 minutes to connect.Not a smooth device.

The fire stick was restarting automatically while in use. Also it looks like it was opened and resealed again. Expected better quality check from Amazon
"I really like the compactness of this whole product.  If you are someone who loves streaming go for it. For me it's like ""paisa vasul!"""
Nice but it is slow and alexa is not localized for regional languages and fails to recognize tamil films.The fire stick is also slow ang hangs sometimes.
The Fire Stick keeps resetting and cannot be used at all.
Excellent product from Amazon.
Got it for 2k on prime day sale. Excellent value for money product.
Firetv sticks working smoothly and browsing all the way i wanted. My all need towards TV and Movies comes to end with it. I love this.
Zee5 sonyliv voot is not free as claimed.It is chargeable.Why misinforming???otherwise its ok.
"Best ever streaming device,Some of the TV are not pair the remote, so check it before buy"
"The device is too slow to handle, process and play the online content. Its hanging each and every time.. very very poor experience."

"My first tv stick, seamless setup, WIFI Bluetooth are working superb, quality and Speed is awesome . Loved it, made my non smart tv to smart tv."
"The second fire TV stick in the house. The product does what it says but, the lag that one faces sometimes are irritating. Hope Amazon fixes this lag stuff over some OTA updates."
Reviewing after 1 month of use. A useful entertainment product from Amazon. Working butter smoothly and flawlessly.
Great but a little laggy I felt.
Mind blowing purchase
"Free Prime membership for three months which was revealed at the time of purchase is not active on this product, pl do the needful"
"Product is very good.But Only one thing i didn't like is there is no MI soundbar listed in amazon fire stick.So those who have MI soundbar, volume in remote won't work."
Just with this device and ofcourse subscription to the OTT platforms my regular LCD turned to a smart TVüòÇ

Just an insane amount of lag with the remote. Fed up of cleaning it.
Switch off and volume control are not there. Remote Carry both button but the command is not picked by firestick.
Worth for money. My LED TV now smart TV.
"Very nice product, easy to control. Just say to Alexa whatever you want to search on any platform. I have purchased this product at 2499."
"It's amazing product, super fast. Good performance with good buffering speed.Good investment for smart entertainment."
Want to replace remote its volume is not working
This is very smooth in the operation and has good inbuilt quality. Voice recognotion is also working very well.
Very good product
Dislike the product.  It will  not with stand more than 7 to 8 days.It is a permanent fitting for LED TV.Care about quality.
There is no volume and tv app control at this price. Disappointed with the policy.
Fire TV stick 3rd generation work perfectly with my LG 32 inch smart TV (2014).

"Not completely lag free but certainly better in response and speed than any smart TV , be it MI, LG, Samsung"
The firestick made my ordinary tv a smart TV. Now I can watch all new shows on the big screen.
Easily damages and the buttons stops working.
Product is good. But I faced difficulty in making it work with my old Sony Bravia TV. Found solution from Quora
useful product. No negative thing.
Watching different apps on HD smart TV
"Hi, I need to complain that my fire tv stick volume keys stopped working automatically 2-3 days ago."
Switching between OTT platforms or back to home area takes time. I thought it would be quicker in the all new 3rd gen. Anyway. It full fills its purpose. Streaming and all is good.
Wonderful stick it worked on my 2011 model samsund 24inch  LCD with HDMI port...
No cover in the package . opened box and broke in 5 days . very cheap plastic . Rusted cell
It doesn't cast from mobile
Remote not supporting my AIWA Led tv no work in power off and up and down volume
I m so confused before purchasing fire stick. But I m fully satisfied. Try must.

What can I say except its easy to install and easier to use. Makes all streaming seamless. Makes my not-so-smart TV truly smart :)
4K firetv stick has far better performance than this 3rd gen stick despite having same clock speed and rom.
Voice recognition was not satisfying for any tamil words. Also had to keep pressing the button is another dislike I had when compared to smart TV with Google assistant

"I bought 2nd Gen fire tv stick.I found the hard way that for tv sticks work in Bluetooth for controlling the tv. The ir in the front is only for power on/off and volume controls.Issues:1. Bluetooth is power hungry, even new aaa battery goes out in 2 hours. ( So i created a habit of buying new batteries, use in fire tv and then use them in my other remotes.)2. I tried customer care they only tell to reset the remote everytime / or changeit battery, ya true. But actually remote eats up battery.3. Due to Bluetooth delay every press will hang up and get pressed randomly. Now with no options u keep the fire stick in store and buy a new Android tv with in built options and a infrared remote.That's what happened to me, hope this helps. If it happened to you try liking this review"
I bought fire tv stick in May 2020 and it stopped working from June 2021. Customer care doesn't replace as warranty is only one year.I have to contact some 3rd party service centre and get it repaired myself and pay for it.Just the price of 4000 for 1 year of streaming services is not at all worth it.
"Please dont get this thing. I got an older model, and just around the time the warranty expired, it started showing problems. Daily disconnections, losing audio often, and the remote always says batteries are low. I can't even complain on the old generation device because it's been discontinued now. Can't get a replacement because the warranty just expired. Absolute waste of money."
"Ordered this for 2399 on 1st day of prime day sale. The next day its price reduced to 2099 with coupons usage. I cancelled the previous order and ordered again. Not good to reduce price like that in just one day in same sale.1st good thing that I really liked is the black bars can be zoomed in from TV picture settings as it is an external device. So you can have full screen HD experience for all those YT,prime videos etc.. FYI if the apps are inbuilt in a smart TV, we cant zoom in like that.. 100 marks here as I always like to watch full screen without black bars.Coming to Alexa, its customized very well that even kids can use it. Bixby voice recognition in samsung smart TVs is one of the worst, it cant understand anything.Picture and Sound Clarity is amazing.All you need is good internet connection and you can forget about dish connections."
"Hello,I  bought firestick 2020 (2nd generation), recently software got updated after which its struck, frequent network disconnections and apps installation not working, So i called customer care, they told me to buy 3rd generation as you are using old one (2020 model, 2nd generation) which is software not supporting properly for your device, if any technical issues are there also no use to do repair, IF THIS IS THE CASE WE NEED TO BUY FIRESTICK EVERY 2 YEARS (after 1 year warranty expires) , INSTED OF BUYING THIS BETTER TO BUY SMART TV."
My firetv stick does not work at all as it gets struck at firetv logo once switched on. I tried all the tricks to reset it and also changed connecting wires. But it is of no use. I received a call from firetv unit to asking me to log a service request and they sent me a email with url details. I raised a service request and also pick up request. It has been more than a week now and it is still not picked up from my address. Once the goods sold there is absolutely no support. And you are lucky if the firetv stick lasts for more than a year.
Not much difference between 3rd gen and 2nd gen. Some keys have been changed that it. I had bought previous version with voice command for 2k in 2020 during prime day. @4k the price is a bit too high. Wait for prime day to get some better deals if you can wait
"Never ever pay subscription or buy a firestick, you will end up paying 1K to prime subscription+ 4 to 5K to fire stick, even after this for each movie you need to pay to 200rs for every 48hrs. Instead y can download, you guys know where"
"I had purchased the firetv stick in 2019. Over the last one year, it started giving error ""No signal"" I tried the diagnosis as per amazon site. But nothing worked. Then I sent it to amazon CTDI. As per email from amazon repair team, the hardware of the amazon firetv stick is faulty and it could not be repaired. Rs 5000 got wasted, as the firetv stick didn't last even 2 years. Now amazon is offering to sell me refurbished firetv stick for Rs 1500 with just 3 months warranty. Prospective customers beware of purchasing firetv stick. I tried to upload screenshot of the email from amazon, but my review got rejected. I will post the review on other sites as well to warn customers, so that they don't lose money."
The installation and updates took time but the UI response and loading of apps is smooth . I got it a 2.4. This is a good price to buy in.  Please introduce a sale again. The voice recognition is not that great as an Google assist.  I have used Alexa products before and they are fast.  But it isn't great here. The buttons are a bit hard and I felt the battery cover slips off while using. If fixed will create even better experience
"I am using the Android TV box for years for my primary TV and bought this product for my PC monitor.Compared to android its performance is a bit laggy, you must need an IR sensor to control audio which is deal breaking. No one would like to change their master volume :(Amazon Fire TV stick is just a skinned version of Android TV and nothing else (with extra restrictions).Pros -CheapEasy loginGood packaging and remote provides a premium feeling.Cons -Volume rockers and power buttons can control TV only no option to control playback volume/switch on/off TV Stick.Too expensive remote (if you need a replacement almost 50% of TV stick price).Difficult to pair my smart devices to Alexa (compared to google assistant)Laggy performance compared to the android box."
It stopped working some days when I called Amazon guys called me for service but they told more than price of amazon fire stick if you give fire stick they code more price for service so that you can't afford when you leave same one they sell online as refurbished piece this is the strategy of amazon....
"Sets up and gets going pretty smoothly. A large collection of apps too, e.g. amazon prime, netflix youtube, sony liv, zee5...... the list goes on and on. However, the honeymoon period proved to be quite brief - the remote died one fine morning. Amazon support tried to revive it remotely and gave up and sent a replacement. The 2nd one also died a few months later and this time Amazon support dragged their feet. The device soon ran out of warranty, Amazon washed their hands off and I am now left with a lemon. We now control the device through an app. I refuse to buy one more simply because I don't believe amazon has figured out and fixed the problem.So be careful. I am using a Google chromecast since three years with no issues ever. Choose your device carefully."
Guys those who are planning to buy the amazon firestick plz avoid buying any of the model. coz all the model works fine for a period of time and suddenly stops working due to malfunctioning of the hardware due to power issues. There is common error called as optimising error. You may google firestick optimising error you get loads of ppl faced the same issue. Customer care doesn‚Äôt care. Moreover there is no solution yet given by amazon tech team. They offer you for the replacement with 15% off on the new device. Think and use ur money wisely.
"I bought this stick 3 years before. After the initial 3 months remote battery never last for more than a week. This is zero day flaw, despite numerous feedback, Amazon refused to replace the remote.There is no support for mirroring from PC or desktop, which Amazon should have supported in first place. I am now using the fire tv android app as remote. Original remote is lying unused and only take that for initial setup."
"1. Stability issues.2. Frequent wifi disconnections.3. Wifi connectivity gives random errors while streaming.4. The UI is painfully slow.5. Horrible Alexa integration. You would think otherwise but no. It would be easy to connect a random product but not Alexa. Such a shame.6. The voice recognition is equally poor. Half the time it doesn't work because the UI is slow. The other times it won't listen. Even if it listens, there is high probability that it will interpret incorrectly.7. The streaming quality is really poor.8. Even the applications they support don't work properly. Most of the time the UI lags. The other times the applications crash.Not even worth ‚Çπ50 and they are selling it for ‚Çπ3999. Such a poor quality product. Looks like they don't even have a QA department. Such a shame."
"Hello , I bought this Amazon fire tv stick 2nd gen for 2999 rs one year back, for using apps it is amazing one very useful for non smart tv's. for some time I enjoyed using this product. suddenly remote is not working. I opened battery case. I saw batteries is like sweating. tried to operate the remote but no use.after remote failed I started using Amazon fire tv app.1. To use Amazon fire tv app we need mobile network and fire tv network should be same.2. and amazon fire tv app and fire tv stick should use same amazon account.here comes the problem.unexpectedly I changed my amazon account password in my PC. here I stuck, not possible to use app also because both amazon accounts are not same.I called amazon customer care to resolve this issue, they simply said no other option buy a amazon new remote which costs me 2000 rs. Amazon fire tv stick bought for 2999, but remote price is 2000 rs.I have a question to Amazon:If your product is not able to use means you have to find a solution.Amazon fir tv remote price should be available for all customers 2000 is high, pls reduce the price.Other than this issues if your remote/fire tv app is working means , you can enjoy the fire tv stick smart features.I hope my review will help some users who are planning to buy this product and for amazon also to take customer concerns and to resolve these types of issues. Thank you"
Don't waste your money on this device. It stops working after 6 months and it drains battery in 10-15 days means you need to change battery twice in one month. Seriously buying this device is total waste on money.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Bought 4k stick about a year ago. Had faced a few issues such as auto closing of my tv, remote fells easily due to the fact it is quite small but that is also a great quality. You need to be delicate with the remote. Sometimes, you need to YouTube to learn resolving issues with the tv and remote. I'd appreciate the quality of the videos that stream. All in all it gives a good user experience."
"Prime day purchase showed free annual subscription to Zee5, SonyLIV, and Voot Select, but post prime day the offer was updated and provided under the fire stick plus option!Now customer service denied any such prime day offer and is only providing a refund option! Newspaper articles on prime day sale still shows the free annual subscription to these 3 channels."
I purchased this fire stick for my grandmother so that she can easily watch tv with voice recognition but fire stick has the worst voice recognition in this entire segment and the interface is not very user friendly
"Product works well, response slow, need high speed Internet, sometimes jumps back to main menu‚Ä¶ very slow response and you gotta wait to move back and forth.Overall a good product to make ur tv smart. Better compared to others as you keep getting updates on it"
Amazone authorised service centre is not capable enough to update software in device which is purchased even not mote than 2 years and asking more money on the name of device replacement. Poor after sale service.
Don't buy if u spend evry year 2k for remote the go for it bocz after 2 to 5 month remote stop working and new remot cost 2k am a buy new remote for 2k  with in 3month stopped Woking.Before 1 year in warrnty am already changeremote once.And it's remote app is wrost u don't depend on remote app am broke my 2 mobile phone.Bcoz app not working 100mbps plan Stabel fiber connection.
"My remote stopped working in 6month, replacement of remote is very costly.. it is around 70% of the product cost.., Amazon should think of reducing the price.."
"The packaging of the product is pretty comprehensive to get started. The initial setup for updating the firmware took a long time but other than that the set up was smooth. I kept getting flicker/dark screens during the set up but it stopped once I changed to another available HDMI port of the TV. But still there were pretty bad quality of video output on display text and even the thumbnails looked very antialiased. I almost returned the item, but realised it was due to the really poor quality HDMI port extender that came with the package. Amazon, please make sure to provide a better quality connecter! I have ordered a separate connector to solve this issue. Removing two stars for this."
"This has to be the worst piece of hardware ever!It feels like the fire tv stick is massively massively under-powered.Apps either hang or crash even if you press the pause/fwd/rewind buttons.In fact, the whole experience is sluggish. Even navigating the app is painfully slow. You click some button and the app responds after 3-4 seconds.Its so frustrating! Worst decision ever to buy this.Should've gone for something else."
Fire stick has only 5+gb  internal memory. Recent updates installed lot other Amazon support background apps which causes app hanging and reduces memory even further. Not recommend at this price. Definitely over priced. Very poor performance and low internal memory.
"I have bought a out 4 fire tv sticks at different points of time considering they are an affordable option for your non-smart tv. But considering I have spent the same amount as an apple tv on these devices and they have all had problems after a year tops, I should have just bought an apple tv.The problem is that they get laggy. The remote does not hold connection with the stick and you have to constantly repair the device. Funnily enough, it is prime video where I am facing extra issues. Videos do not play and the screen just reloads into the title screen. Overall, terrible user experience after some time. Would suggest to buy a smart tv itself or apple tv/Chromecast."
"Excessive bloatware and spyware that spoils the pleasure of watching any programs. Apps open slow, response to remote is slow, all due to hundreds of apps. Most of the hidden apps cannot be deleted even using Android Debug Bridge. Otherwise, pircture quality and convenience is good."
overpriced gadget.. it should be around 2500 to 2000.. evry streaming device have same specs and processor so why this price increasing
"The latest updates messed up it all previously it was having everything to look for but the latest update made it like any android tv worst update you should have to ask for user acceptance before blindly applying it, not have any option will  go for cancellation of subscription"
"It stopped working in 3 months and also there is no replacement policy. Only refund policy. So if you buy during sale, you willl not be able to purchase at discounted price again. Would not recommend. There are many ohter better alternatives with decent warranty."
"Fire stick started as an excellent streaming device to start with, but, after 1.5 years it started showing its quality. Worst ever experience. Keeps crashing after every 10-15 mins.I did a factory reset and just installed 4 applications, but, nothing worked.If you need a streaming device for a year or so, it's fine but don't expect more.Expensive but life is to small. Not happy."
"Right from the purchase, fire stick had several issues. Customer contact service was also informed.Intially there was issue of sluggish remote response ie stopped working intermittently. Later problem started with several chain of loading the Amazon page.Now the stick completely stopped working within three months of buying the product.Will not buy and recommend not to buy the product in future.There could be issue that defected product was supplied during the sale Amazon sale period as vendors get opportunity to push defected product during this period."
"The fireTV stick can only access the Audio from the TV and in case a Sound bar or a Bluetooth speaker is connected to the FireTV's Bluetooth, the Volume control does not work with the remote.You need to manually go to the soundbar or the BT speaker and increase the volume.The remote provided has an IR blaster which takes control of only the Audio from the TV, hence any BT devices connected to the fireTV, the volume needs to be adjusted manually.To people who have a neckband, the audio controls are available on the neckband.But in case you use a Earpod, then there is no way to control the Volume."
"yes features are good but experience is worst, videos get stuck frequently, processing power is worst. Performance is inconsistent may be due to cheap quality Chinese hardware"
Poor product with poor quality.Remote is very bad in terms of quality.Avoid it and beteer to go other product.Noce to go with other options
Why Amazon not offering to return the old one while buying the new one? Why they don't want to decrease the e-waste?
"I bought this firestick & mi stick at same time and almost at same price. MI stick was imported one & supporting 4K. MI stick & remote still working but firestick remote not working for a long time. If you want to run heavy apps like Kodi, experience is far better in Mi box as firestick feel hung often."
"Fire stick is going to dead soon. It's really headache to operate it. It's stuck anywhere, too slow to move from one app to another app. APPS quality is also not good. Even main apps like Netflix, Sony live, Hot star stuck and close automatically. Not really smooth experience.  Nativations is really pathetic. Not recommended."
"Video streaming is fine with cursor, after couple of months Alexa voice search not working though it is receiving command on fire stick.... very tried fixing through options mentioned in Google...but all efforts in vain.."
Good product to make your ordinary tv smart. Frequently updated software make always new interface. Easy to use. Voice commands accepted. Very handy to carry to a new location. No issues from the date of purchase.Buy it. You will love it
Setting up is very simple and easy. Alexa is much more smart now. What I dislike that whatever app I install onto Fire stick is added to Amazon Order. Otherwise its good.
"Bought Fire stick for Rs. 2999 at Flipkart. Able to connect to LG Flatron using HDMI to AV convertor bought at Amazon. Streaming fine. But fire stick gets overheated quickly. Same concern for my friends as well, but streaming fine."
"Product quality and service is good as it is, the interface works good too. But the Wi-Fi reception is absolute terrible. When I say absolute terrible I mean complete garbage. It keeps on loading Netflix and other services all the time, even though the router is like just 5 metres away from the TV. And I‚Äôve never got to stream anything in full HD ever.Just terrible, massive complaint, writing this out of frustration."
Very good. Only issue so far is if we stream continuously for more than 4-5 hours and if we use forward or rewind then streaming structs. We need to come back to home screen and again select the video.
"Overall, fireTV stick is an Amazing product. But I am surprised to see that some apps like VI Movies & TV, Jio TV etc are not available in their app store. Hence, it is not possible to use the Fire TV to its fullest. Hope they will make them available soon."
good quality firestick‚Ä¶amazon products are of great quality‚Ä¶stream quality is impressive‚Ä¶highly recommended‚Ä¶nice quality plastic and feels premium‚Ä¶must buy this item
Bought 3rd gen fire stick. Could not sync the fire stick and remote which means It‚Äôs own 2 products are not able to sync.Am really disappointed by the quality of Amazon who doesn‚Äôt do basic quality check and send the products. Asked me to wait for 3 days before I get some resolution. But why should I wait when I have already paid for the product? Does Amazon wait for the payment till the time I start using the product?
"Good voice recognition,  also screen mirroring direct happens without any other wifi connectivity. Comes with its charger to charge fire stick its too good."
"It boots slow, the response is slow, connectivity to WiFi is even slower. It takes 5 -10mins to connect to WiFi at distance of 3 meters in the same room, no obstacles in between."
"Excellent AND I love converting my 22""  AOC TV to a SMART TV. After changing option to Change TV, POWER, VOLUME &MUTE buttons are also working FINE."
Firestick is too slow to load after a restart. App store has limited number of apps only. Jio tv app not supported. Few apps even crashed while using. Ram usage shows above 60% even with only 2-3 apps installed. Out of 8gb only 4 gb was usable. So returned
The device is good but:amazon bragged a lot about the 3rd gen firestick and 2 star is only for lying; that its 50% fast than the 2nd generation of firestick but its not even 1% faster than 2nd gen of firestick. very disappointed with amazon for lying to the customers like this!!
New UI(Update) have ruined the device. Not at all recommended. Very slow and lot of crashes. Update is heavy for the hardware.
You need to replace battery every 3 days. Got remote replaced but no improvement. Amazon please provide sustainable solution for problem.
Most pathetic product by the house of Amazon. All other are good. Total 3 remote not working till now and remote itself is a 2000 rs product. You can check my order history
"It keeps getting stuck and I have to restart it over and over again! What a waste of money!Didn‚Äôt expect this from amazon. But yeah, firestick sucks!"
This review is for Amazon and not for the product. The price of this product got reduced close to 40% with in one week from the date I bought it. Utterly disappointed
Remote will cost you 2k and this is a big problem you are going to face if you buy fire stick. In 1  year my remote stopped working. There is no option you have other than to spend the cost of fire stick.Think twice as you have other options and all apps will work in many.
"I've purchased 3, works fine but voice recognition doesn't work in 2. Still I'd say a must have in all homes. Do away with cable connection and install a WiFi"
They provide incompatible batteries with the purchase so it is better to purchaze the set without the batteries andnot waste money.They provide AAAA batteries when AAA batteries are included in the remote.
"Hi, Bro brought a fire stick after 3 months of usage remote stopped working, remote can‚Äôt be repaired.. spent 2000 for new remote again,  fire stick remote's are like use and throw type...again fire stick had a problem launching apps issue  and accessing apps error....fire stick is not worth of 1500"
"I have been using Mi Box, in comparison Fire stick was not so impressive to me, and most importantly, I had to return it due to volume buttons not working on the remote."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I have recorded the video. The remote is only blinking orange light. The screen is stuck on the wifi page.Googled various try, watched tons of videos but no help... This sucks"
Good product. Works fine .but couldn't figure out what was this lite version....... Go for it .Thanks AMAZONThanks again
"After only about half a year of purchase, it started restarting on its own, started overheating, already had to factory restart twice, it doesn't recognise its own remote, had it replaced once, disconnects from the wifi and does not reconnect till we unplug and plug it back in. Would not recommend."
"Very slow processing, repeatedly apps are crashing, only good for youtube. video sticking during playing even I am @ 100MBPS 5Ghz network. Don't go for it"
"Since I have bought this its been over a year now. I am facing the issue like the whole day it keeps running optimizing screen. wrote & called Amazon but they are not interested in fixing up the issue, They are least interested as we are Indians so customer satisfaction is not important. They can treat us the way they want."
"Best in its price range ,smooth and lag free functions. Kudos to all the app integration. User interface is swift and well simple to use..."
I am writing review after 6+ months of use. Device start hang after some days. Remote stop working. Too much wait while launching app. Pls do not buy. There is no response from customer care
This device don't work with Lan cable internet. For that you have to invest in adapter which cost 1500/- to 2000/-. I prefer to watch ott on my MacBook now. Ove hype product.. it should be in range of just 500/- around.
"Alexa is very helpful. She has become like a family member. Reminders are very helpful. She is so cute, at times you forget that it's AI that you are dealing with."
Volume is not working and blank screen appears while firetv stick setup and while playing the movie all of a sudden blank screen appears. Very bad product from amazon which is not expected
Very bad product no power cable available in the box .and the device is also not working remote control is not good .volume and power button not working .everytime u turned on it gone blank screen display after fire tv logo and sound I talked to customer care for replacement then I came to know that only refund available.it was very bad experience I am not expecting from Amazon  .
Very good stream quality and good voice quality also. Worth buying. Easy to operate. Quality product. Lots of my friends bought after me
Received fire TV stick lite instead of 3rd gen. Awaiting replacement. Bulb received was perfect but Amazon customer service support resolved the matter quickly and sent new fire TV stick 3rd gen within two days. So thanks Amazon. Keep up the good work
Amazing product.... Thanks amazon.... Streaming quality is very good... Thanks next order coming soon.... Amazon's always good quality products sold....
Works great! Firestick is too good. Works great on my LED tv and converts the TV to smart TV. Don‚Äôt think much just go for it!
It's not at all good for a long run. It'll work well for 1 year and then it'll start giving issues. It becomes soo slow even with strong wifi and storage space. Remote also stops working after sometime and demands for a battery change every month. Bad experience.
"good one easy to use , working fine with my tv and the best thing that other remotes is universalworking fine with my tv and the best thing that other remotes is universal"
"It takes a long time to load, change channels and even going back..Waste of money‚Ä¶Worst piece of software .. Amazon scamming us with horrible products"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Tv got damaged by using this fire stick. Got a big loss off amount with it.Cant recommend for this type off device. When call on customer care they want lots off details and investigation rather than rectify the issue."
"Picture quality perfect, Stream quality perfect, Voice commanding perfect.Overall it was amazing and the remote was compact too which maker it light and handy to use."
No own Volume controls like as set top box. This is only work with sounds bar or tv volume control UI. Please updated the same in firestick. So better used for the remote volume control feature.
"Received faulty device. The home screen keep on refreshing even after latest update. It is not allowing me to open any of the apps. Not much apps are available. App store experience is not at all good, it does not have all the apps. Could not able to install atleast opera browser."
You cannot buy only remote. Remote cost is same as stick cost. My remote stopped working in just 2-3 days. After that stick is useless as you cannot connect to wifi without remote.Suggestion to manufacture: make remote available at sensible price. INR 3000 for Remote is just absurd.
"Poor product, It receives updates frequently and post every update it stops working. Then begins the mammoth task of dealing with horrible call centre. The only solution they provide is to get the firestick repaired, just imagine you purchase a product and with every update you need to get it repaired. what a business idea......"
"You could mention stream quality, alexa integration or voice recognition Good good nice proud and very use in good  product"
I was purchase fire stick last year now this created problemsNetwork issueAfter that purchase new fire stick 3rd generationNow this product work properly in same Network conditionCan i know what is this ??????
"Don't have a second thought, just buy it. Streaming is fabulous. HD Clarity and Sound is awesome. But I have purchased from Reliance digital."
I have given 1 star because it has a very big problem after 5 months fire stick restarts again and agin and it's a loop due to excess heating I tried all the solution and nothing works. Costumer service is very bad
After 10 days Bluetooth Connectivity stop working and after that no Support from Amazon. Worst after sale service. some customer service advisor said that my music system not is working other says purchase new one and then return it.
"Its the worst product I purchased from Amazon, hardly last few days more than one year. Now its out of warranty and of no use. I lost 4000 k for a bad quality product.  MI 4k is much better and I am using it now. This is a genune advice from my end. I lost my money, I hope some one else can save it."
Multiple OTT can be viewed in excellent HD quality. Easy to hold remote. Very useful product by Amazon to consolidate all video streaming platforms
"After using for one year smoothly, now the remote is not working...Please help. what should I do.Is there any service center at Burdwan, West Bengal."
"The product was working fine until about last week - now it asks me to pay a Tata Sky Binge subscription to watch channels such as Sony LIV and Zee5, which are channels I already subscribe to separately. Do not buy this product. Amazon has made a deal with Tata Sky and is forcing you to pay for what you do not need."
Worst product ever.. after few months it will work very slow and the remote will stop working.. to buy another remote it is approx ‚Çπ2000/-.. which is worthless.. instead buy Apple TV.. doesnt deserve a 1star also..
"Excellent product. Only thing didn't like that Remote has not complete setup with TV. Power is working but volume key not working, tried setting up multiple times. Other wise a 5 star product."
It's better not to but Amazon firestick. It's stop working after one year. After warranty they are charging 1500 for replacement. And giving 3 months warranty.It's a software issue. They won't last long.. waste of money to buy firestick .it's better watch on smart tv installing apps
Very easy to show movies etc and fast streaming device for non android tv users...I like very much after installation
Product is good. But frequently ask to remove some programs to create minimum working space. Sharp pictures and good sound quality but unfortunately with a very bad remote.
"If you buy this stick and suddenly it's stop working, u are not able to find any customer support... Don't buy this if you want internet in TV buy Smart Tv..."
Excellent Device for Streaming Majority of OTT apps available with ease of use via Alexa enabled remote. Ideal for Senior Citizen to operate
"Comparing 1st generation it's very slow, UI  is bit complicated.  1st and 2nd generation even my Grand pa used it easily. I bought alomst 6 fire stick of f 1st and 2nd gen.  For this need lot of improvement in UI and Performance"
"Price is little high , you can get a smart Television instead of this in little more amount I think"
"Excellent fire tv stick. Stream quality, Alexa integration and voice recognition are good. No nagetive review to write. Thanks Amazon."
"Wifi connecting problem, wifi not connecting properly, it's always showing wifi is not in range r check ur wifi device."
I have bought this firestick 3 years already and it still lasts. excellent updates. i have panasonic 32 inch LED tv and its not smart TV. But this firestick changes everything. so glad i made the purchase. I havent even changed remote battery yet.
"My television started flickering in few days after fire tv stick installation, amazon don't have service for fire tv stick is super weird. Very tempting product but can cause ur television ."
Data consumption is very high. You can't even watch a movie in lowest pixel density. 2 GB data gone in just 1/2 an hour Using Amazon prime. Wastage of money. Better to purchase jio fibre if you really want to watch tv peacefully.
made up quality is okay!but easy to use and excellent product.loved it ............video quality is excellent & response time also
The most convenient and easy to use. Blindly go for it. Even non smart TV are compatible. I bought casting devices  earlier which were nothing short of waste.

"Streaming is very fast, recommend must buy this product. I am writing this review after using it for three months."
After sales service is really bad.. They will amke you call few places and no solid arrangement for repairing of these fire stick devices. Mi tv stick is far far better.
"From day 1, it's been lagging, the stick won't respond to the remote, I tried new batteries, different television sets, my wifi speed is 150 Mbps so it's not even an internet issue. It basically sucks. Buy other good quality android tv box, not this."
Well All Features Liked. First Time Experience Not Bad. More on About Really No Idea But Hopefully THE BEST In All
Sounds and picture quality is very goodGood remoteVoice Command very goodApps are very goodThanks for amzon
"It just kept hanging right out of the box. And finally after few hours, even stopped booting up. Not recommended"
I would suggest not to buy amazon fire stick if u want to replace ur dth with new technology...Cos the subscription they are providing doesnot run at all. If u want a additional device to view other stuffs n subcription then i will suggest go for it.
"Remote is worst quality, and very costly to change 2k,So if you are buying the product then ready to operate firestick by mobile Only, because remote stop working by few months.Although fire stick is good for steaming video"
Bought a stick few years ago. But the device is slow as snail. Dont but better get android tv box
Super product go ahead and buy it. Value for money. Stream quality is also good. And the home screen is also improved.
please don't buy this .they provide very cheap remote . it will stop working after few days and they won't replace it ..
"The media could not be loaded.

"Fire TV stick quality is very bad , many functions were not working. Like sound , Alexa and two three more"
Remote is not working? What is the solution? Please give me the suggestion for working. I am using with my mobile.
I have use it but now not working. If connected to tv show no signal msg. On wi fi router it shows connected to wifi network. There no any service centre to repair. I think life of stick may be 2 to 3 years.
Waste product no service available cheating product i dont like that.my money will be backThe costomer care is not working
Alexa recognition in fire stick is good. Excellent product. The power boot up is very fast. Overall good. Safe to use.
Very nice product user friendly and price range is also very gd. I was got 2399/- during prime sale.
"Not doing well as required no voice recognition,bad streaming,waste of money,not good not upto the mark.to be improved for good quality."
I like the product but i don't get mx player preloaded in it please make it compatible with more apps
Gen 3 is little bit faster and smootherWith new key featuresBest products to convert ur tv to smart
"It is disconnecting frequently without any reasons, despite the fact that the Internet Connection responding excellently but the Fire Stick is not responding, satisfactorily. Please refund the amount."
Adapter was damaged so used mobile adapter. It tooks time to connect it. Else overall is good. Easy to handle.
"Good for convert Smart TV to Normal LED TV.It's operate very well not having issue, I am using since last two months."
It's very good device with good connectivity speed............Alexa is awesome . Good selection of programs available.Need to have good package
Totally disgusting quality don't buy this because this fire tv stick has an laging problem always I'm totally disturbed and when I'm complaining about this they are not getting my complaint..üò°üò°

No ott subscriptions received with product as mentioned. It says that i am not eligible for the offer Very disappointing.
Easy to use. The streaming quality is good. Tv volume adjusted properly.Very happy with the buy. Go for it.
The only drawback is that it is super slow and that‚Äôs a reason big enough to throw it in the dustbin.I am left frustrated every time I switch on my TV.
Bakwaaaaaas product.....dnt buy....Mera 1 set kachre k dabbbe m pda hai........Sony tv m work hi nahi kiya....
Very Good Product with good solution (Volume level control & power button)Don‚Äôt need Tv remote for volume control & turn on/off

Remote Battery cover(‡§°‡§ï‡§®) is very loose. I am very sad about it. Please rectify it if possible. It falls down self more time
Stream quality is just reasonable. Alexa feature not quick in response. Applications doesn't even load without internet. Not worthy to buy
"Fire TV stopped working, please share customer care number for India (Hyderabad). Need urgent help.. I tried just few numbers but no satisfactory response."
Do i get aha ott app in fire stick to get access in the TV shall I download it in my television
"It's a very good product, make my TV full android and give best video quality, the Alexa voice assistant works very fast."

All streaming n volume control us good .I am now facing problem is only YouTube nit displaying last 10days..if possible send suggestions on my mail id ..mhatre 0112@Gmail com.
Remote is very handy.Quickly interchangeable from one ott platform to another.Alexa response is not good sometimes.Overall a good product.
What is the use of this device if all tv's are becoming  smart now?. Can you tell me the cheap and best device which is compatible  with fire stick?
Got it on offer for 2100rs sale + coupon etc. (Yes the 3rd gen ü§£)Really impressed with the product and a life saver for old tv.
üëç good product. Amazon is doing a good job. Good quality and features. A good buy for fun and entertainment.
Kindly arrange service center address? Or arrange pick up from address device not working after 1 year. Or replace it.
Not useful for them who have already smart tv. Old model tv can use this as like chrome cast and other things
"It dint work, also after seeing it clearly visible that some1 returned it n they sold same to me saying it's new piece."
"Device multiple buttons are not wotking properly like power, volumn and mute buttons. Otherwise stream and sound quality of the device is good."

"Everything is awesome, you can even download extra apps from the web, a very little problem with it is sometimes the YouTube cast doesn't work, but otherwise it's awesome."
Suddenly remote stopped working. Only light blinking but not connecting to fire stick. Don‚Äôt know how to contact costumers care.
Till now its good lets see how it goes for and even after three months lets see how it works
For watching Amazon prime online  movies and entertainment channels and american Hollywood movies and cartoons channels Discovery channels and screen mirroring
It might be best streaming device Amazon came up with but YouTube has stop supporting fire stick.Voice Recognition is less than expected
"Picture and sound quality is amazing, operation is smooth. The stream quality is excellent and the voice recognition is great. Overall it is an amazing product!"
Regularly we are facing remote issues and screen not visible properly and showing no signal on tv screen. Streaming is ok
Stream Quality is very nice and note i am running in my old led tv which hasn't hdmi port and i am using it with connector
"I like this prodict it is worth than buying an samrt tv, simple to handle.thre is no nwgative in this item."

"Why apps shown on Firestick cannot be downloaded? Sonyliv ,Discovery, Hotstar or any apps in demand is not available to download ?!!"
Its amazing and very useful for them who haven't smart tv . Just mirror with phone and enjoy and reduce your cable bill.
Can't integrated with my tv and not up to mark for use. Very patchy installation in tv. Looking not good.

"Fire tv stick 3rd gen is a magical device. Got this for my non-smart 2018 Sony TV.Streaming quality is 1080p max with Dolby Atmos. For Dolby Atmos you will need separate Dolby Atmos enabled soundbar/system to work.Supports all apps almost like YouTube, Prime video, Amazon music, Netflix, Voot, Zee5, Disney+hotstar, Apple TV etc. You may require separate subscription for each app.Bluetooth remote is very responsive with inbuilt Alexa button.You will require high speed unlimited broadband connection to run this otherwise it may not work properly.Got it on the prime day at just Rs.2099. Thanks to Amazon for fast delivery."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I like the performances without any doubt. I tried the 3rd generation firestick with our one plus 65"" android TV. I am very much impressed. I have also used on my LG 32inch TV also. I have observed the same quality of performance. Every thing is working fine and I updated the software also very easily. I am not having WiFi and I am using Hotspot from my mobile. Performance is undoubtedly excellent. I recommend to interested customers to go for this where Hd port is available for their TV's."
"I have been using it from more than a month and it is performing flawlessly. First thing i liked was perfectly packaged thing. Remote batteries dongle, HDMI adapter, charging brick. Second thing setting up was easy and full of information and text. The remote controls the TV as well On/OFF my VU TV was listed and there were almost all brands of TV available even the names which you might have never heard off.  Easy to install and the DONGLE is dual band can receive 5G and 2.5G wifi network. Streaming is super smooth no lags. The device itself is very powerful compared to the new  budget smart TVs that have a low RAM/ Speed processor. So surfing channels and using Alexa is breeze. Overall i would highly recommend to get this thing if you have a smart TV,Now all you need is just the remote plus everything hides behind the TV so no one can ever tell that the TV is non smart and has been converted :) For a full videos review you can check youtube video on my channel lightsky motion Pictures"
Bought this for MarQ By Flipkart InnoView 109 cm (43 inch) Full HD LED (43DAFHD) and it worked like charm. An Amazon product for a Flipkart product. It really worked well and now can enjoy things in big screen. Almost every thing I watch are in this list providing many apps which just need a subscription. Great product in this offered price 2199. The process is simple and installation takes 10min which it does itself with the Wifi connection.  The controls and settings are clear and helpful.
"I have given a five star but will start from sad part. First I purchased firestick plus with zee5, voot and Sony LIV subscription. I got the delivery in 4 days. I signed in with my credentials. Everything worked super fine. The remote paired at first attempt itself. I was dilkush. But this wasn't last for long. I downloaded all files and checked pre subscribed packs. But the fate is it wasn't subscribed. Was asking to purchase it again. I contacted Amazon customer care. They gave few tips which doesn't seem to working with me. So I thought to return it and purchase without subscription (I could have kept it but since I paid 1k extra and was no use, thought of returning it). I ordered new one without subscriptions and got the item within 4 days(Thanks to Amazon delivery). Even now everything worked fine. I was worried on reading few reviews that the remote doesn't pair, but in my case it paired at very 1st attempt. Now there is diwali offer on few subscriptions where we get annual packs for low prices. Purchased zee5 for 500.So better not to waste on firetv plus and waste your time calling customer care(may work fine but it is just 2 lucky out of 10, where all 3 works good). Except purchase normal one and subscribe yourself which works all tasks in few minutes. Anyway the fire os is best and it is rocking . Dolby sound is plus point in this. Don't think twice just go for it without further thinking."
"UPDATE:Yes. Dobly Atmos works with this version compared to my 2nd gen Firestick 4K.  Came to rescue when that didnt work !Original ReviewI got 4k for almost two years and was very happy with it. That's used for my TV and it's butter smooth.  Later I wanted to buy one for projector. As it didn't support power/volume button on firestick, ordered the lite on launch day. Was happy with that too but that was not fast as 4k.I was eyeing on the new remote with 3rd gen stick and what a better time to purchase than this.Now coming to this device.Quick activation. If you are buying for yourself, please check the ""link to my account"" . No need of manual setup..Streaming quality is superb and it's in full hd resolution as you all knowAlexa integration - mic symbol replaced with alexa icon. It opens apps/channels without a problem. Have been using that for longRemote. Wish there was hotstar/sony instead of Amazon music. Prime video/Netflix buttons are very useful.Only surprise ::  I have an old 22"" Del monitor which got HDMI input. Unfortunately it didn't give output on that. I was in the impression that it works on any device with HDMI inputs. As Amazon gives you a no question asked return in 10 days, you need not worry.I used mi stick and mibox before. There is a huge difference between them and firestick devices.Prices are never been better. Remote costs üòÄHope someone find it useful."
I have used Mi box 4K And Mi stick also ..i am giving Honest review .Actually there a difference between speed of iphone and Android .That's what you will get in Firestick as compare to Mi android box..Alexa works like charm in Firestick ..Android search is very very very very poor i can't explain ..mere parents were irritated while doing voice search in Mi box ..I recommend everyone to go for Firestick without even thinking ..This fire stick  supports all applications of android and better app store compare to Mi box..You will get application that are not available on Mi box ...I am really happy with my decision of going with this after my Mi box stopped working within year ...
"Perfect streaming device. But if you think that you'll install a JioTV app and say goodbye to your regular TV Dish then it's not that easy. Bcoz after installing JioTV, you've to control it through FireTV Remote and it's not an easy work as JioTV app made for your laptop & smartphone but you've no cursers or painting device for TV.Other than that, everything is perfect. You'll convert your non-smart TV into smarter one. Go for it."
"I have smart tv at home and for second unit i am using Comcast but it is not very dependable and i was waiting for some solution to get ride of it .  Fire tv is more like mini android phone or having cheaper version of apple tv .Ui is awesome but stick is not that fast and kind a laggy ( typical android kind a thing ) . But can‚Äôt complain.One more reason to like it more is bluetooth support for headphones or earphones ( you can‚Äôt pair two headphones or earphones simultaneously)  With dolby digital plus watching HQ content is perk .Try to avoid 4k edition if you have smart tv or even if not now a day Smart TV available for 12-15k so not logical to spend 4-5k for stick only . Among all Indian edition is good deal ( i got it for 2,000‚Çπ )Go for it really liked it alot ."
"I own a GoogleChromecast, and honestly, The Amazon fire stick was the best decision I've made. I've used chrome for 5 yrs now (1st Generation), the Amazon firestick I purchased it yesterday, so the review below is just a day one experience.@Chromecast vs Firestick#difference.- Phone V/S remote- limited apps V/S unlimited apps- online only V/S can download content and take it along anywhere- have to set up from scratch every time you change the wifi V/S need to only change wifi details#Common:- can create up to 6 profiles- wifi connection required (obviously) I have heard that you can download on the firestick and take it with you if you're traveling (not sure of this works)"
"I have and am using mi stick.  This was for the second tv.  The Amazon prime part is very fast.  YouTube like normal speed.  Most other apps are there.  My major 2 cons are.  a). There is no instructions on how it starts.  It was prompting me to push a 3 dot button on my remote which was not there.  I randomly clicked some buttons and it started.  b). In the Amazon app in Android tv there is a move video button which shows the scenes much like YouTube.  Could not do that in fire stick.  But other than that, the speed is really good.  Will be checking more and updating.  Alexa assistant is a bit of a hit and miss and in my case more miss.  This inspite of me having an Alexa at home and that is working well.  So this was surprising.  May get well with time."
"Got this at a cheap price during the Amazon sale during October 2021.Very easy to set up with the self explanatory guide. Takes about 15 minutes to update your fire stick and finish set up.The updated 2021 version comes with the new remote with which you can control everything, so much so after buying and setting this up you won't require your original TV remote again.The Alexa app does a decent job of recognising your voice and following the command.Stream quality is excellent.The only drawback or inefficiency is in the live TV button given in the remote and the option itself.It's meant to pull all the live TV channels from your subscribed apps and display them together so that you don't have to open the apps separately.But in spite of 'syncing' multiple times, fire TV couldn't sync and show the channels from the apps"
"Updated Review.Looks like it's a mistake happened from the developers who added a wrong product.Customer care team contacted me and asked me to order 8 AAA batteries and once it's delivered they have refunded the amount. So basically my issue has been fixed. Thank you so much Amazon.I got this product for 1999 rs for one 3rd gen fire stick. Bought this product since my second generation firestick stopped working after 3 years and repairing cost is1500 Rs.Orginal Review on 24th October 2021As per the combo pack description, two firestick and one set of 4 AAA batteries are included, but they are sending AAAA batteries instead of AAA batteries which we can't use anywhere in the firestick remote. Resolve my issue and I'll edit my review."
"I was already using the Fire Stick Lite on my LED tv so the functions and interface were not new to me, I ordered this one to use it with my projector as I was very sure that it will work. I'm currently using egate 9 projector with Fire Stick 3rd generation and what a experience!! You can see the difference when you connect the projector with laptop and then with Fire Stick. The first difference you will notice is the picture quality and the second and most important due to which I ordered my second Fire Stick is the discrepancy in synchronization of audio and video while connected to laptop. Problem solved and now I can enjoy uninterrupted movies and webseries on 130 inch huge screen."
Good but some times Alexa says cannot connect to server try again so U need to restart it to work ...and it has problem of getting struck in Netflix mostly and restarting is only the option these issues are small but I believe they need to be rectified for better performance... Streaming quality is good ... I have reported the problem to call centre and they have sent me a new device in a day which is good ... So the service if fast and good ... But still have the issue with Alexa but the new device does not get struck during use... Must be some software problem ... But I still recommend firestick because of the service and all the other positives .
"Must buy if you find it under 2500 again.I got free prime subscription for 3 months as well.Few points:1. Always purchase this version. Dont buy lite version. I returned lite version. Reason is bluetooth audio. Lite version has very low bluetooth audio and you can not even hear dialogues.  This version of sticks has volume controls for bluetooth devices with latest firmware update so you can use fire stick remote to control your bluetooth headphone/soundbar audio. Trust me this helps a lot. Please update firestick bios to use this feature.2. Voice recognition on this version is very great and works on all apps.3. If you are connecting with aux cable or want to is TV Audio, please use PCM onlyoption fron audio settings on stick.4. If your bluetooth headphone/ soundbar has Bluetooth 5.0 then there is no lag in audio while watching movies. You can blindly purchase this stick as this has bluetooth version 5.0.  Other sticks like Mi and realme has bluetooth 4.0 which results in audio lag.I am using it with projector with soundbar and I am getting true theatre like feeling no doubt."
"Great device, very performant. Doesn't lag on my Jio Wifi at 30 Mbps speed. Great picture quality. Only problem is that it didn't work fully with my Noble Skiodo TV - the volume and power buttons didn't integrate with the TV's software. Amazon should let customers know beforehand which TVs it works with. I saw Noble Skiodo in the list of TVs while setting up this remote but somehow it was not able to download the TV control software from their website. Noble Skiodo TV model that I had is no longer available on Amazon so that may be responsible for lack of software. Anyways, I returned it to buy a Fire TV stick Lite edition which doesn't have power and volume controls and will save me 400 Rs. I purchased this device for Rs 2199 in October 2021."
"Quality product at a competitive price with regular updates from amazon Long lasting device. Highly reliable & feature rich, amazon needs to upgrade the hardware of the amazon firestick as well.Alexa is a great pal & help to my father (84 Years Old) who finds simple key operations difficult.Presently firestick entertaining & keeping my Father & mother occupied daily.Still using my old firestick (working flawlessly with regular updates) bought in 14 Aug 2017The present firestick purchase is being kept as standby.Mogambo Khush hua!!!"
"If you do not own this and own a TV you are missing something . Stop reading reviews and just order this. Life will be more peaceful. And do get that Netflix subscription. The lowest subscription works best.  Of course this means you will do less housework, spend less time in the gym, talk less to useless friends. But what a great device for you and your wife/husband to quietly spend the evening watching the movie ""Chances Are ...."""
"I had a very old fire stick maybe the 1st generation, now upgraded to this 3rd gen, and the speed as promised is 50% more (in fact more for me as I am migrating from a very old stick).Option / menus and response time are minimal. More importantly I can control my TV on/off and volume from fire stick. Full value for money. Got it at a good price in the amazon sale."
Its great for making a dumb tv or monitor smart.It will remain unused after the novelty wears out.I use this device to play youtube and stream movies to my dumb tv. That happens once a week. Some videos I can play by copying them to a usb drive. Do I need this? No. Does it serve it's purpose? Yes.
"I have a plasma non Android TV in my house. It was going on well since I bought it five years back. Thought not to sell it in olx but I got an idea, immediately I ordered Amazon TV stick and now I am enjoying Android TV with the help of this. Beautiful clarity, Cristal clear sound and everything. Thank you Amazon."
"Good purchase I would say. The initial setup took sometime (probably due to my slow net connection). Amazon prime comes pre-installed. You might need to manually download other streaming platforms. The Remote is cool and handy. Works well with all navigation. The volume button only works for the TV. It doesn't have a volume function built in inside the Stick I think. Picture quality is good.  Regarding Audio, I connect the Fire Stick directly to my Harman AVR HDMI port which has only upto Dolby TruHd capability not Atmos. The display will always shows Dolby Digital Plus. And on new Amazon titles I get a clearer 3.2.1 surround sound @48Khz and 2.0.0 on old titles where the display still shows Dolby Digital Plus!Overall, it's a good buy. If you have a Dolby Atmos capable receiver and setup, then just go blindly and enjoy!"
"Product is working fine. However during ordering on prime day I was promised 1 year subscription for sonyliv, zee 5 and voot. Now Amazon support team is denying it and asking for screenshot as a proof. Who takes screenshot of offers ü§¶. Expected better service from Amazon."
Sturdy build.Easy installation.User-friendly interface.Smooth streaming without any delay.Great picture quality.Alexa activated remote works flawlessly.Valur for money product.But a button to totally switching off the Fire TV Stick device is required for other products like AmazonBasics HDMI Auto Switch to work properly.
"So much faster than my previous Gen 1 Fire Stick. The new UI is meh (banner full of ads is not what I want to see when I start it up), but the performance has been faultless so far. Boots up quickly too. And no issues with Bluetooth peripherals like the previous one. Only deducting one star because of the abysmal build quality of the remote. The joystick and the battery cover creak every time I hold it. Feels extremely fragile. Added buttons on the remote are a timesaver. But please do something about it‚Äôs build in the next iteration."
"First things first!!!!! The no-1 TV Stick in Indian Market...This 3rd Generation Fire TV stick has a superb build quality. The remote has a premium look & feels great in hand. The set-up with TV is just seamless. For normal size TV the HDMI extension cord is not required. If you require, it is inside the box, so not to worry :-)Now coming to the streaming quality. It is wow wow wow.. Dolby Sound quality gives a surround feeling & is great (I have tried this with my Sony 5.1 sound system though). You need to install the apps you want watch, like Hotstar, Zee5, Voot, Disney+, Hoichoi etc etc. etc. The Overall experience with these apps are really cool. The newly introduced Live section seamlessly connect to LIVE channels via the installed apps.In the Verdict I will suggest if you want to convert your TV in a full house of entertainment & cool features, then you go blindly for this. Its the ultimate TV stick for you."
"This is my first time buying the Amazon fire tv stick and its very good i really liked it a lot. U can make your non smart tv into a smart tv with this fire stick its that good.  The alexa feature is also good can make our task so easy with our voice recognition. But the Amazon fire tv stick gets heated soon when u use full HD streaming, but other wise its very good. üëçüëçüòä"
"HDMI extender not working.  I need replacement of this item.  Then i will give 5 star rating.  Fire stick is working fine.  Every time I want to remove the stick, I have to remove the tv from wall mount and then remove."
I got a broken seal package. All the contents were intact and looked unused. This has never happened earlier with Amazon. Needless to talk about the flawless and excellent experience using this firestick.. it makes my old LED a smart TV. Dedicated buttons also make it easy to switch channels without going to home page.
I was already having a smart TV with you tube & Netflix as the only 2 options . However I wanted to explore other OTT platforms too . I had even thought of replacing my Sony TV. Then a friend suggested Fire stick ! I ordered it & since then I have watched almost all good shows on OTT ‚Ä¶.what I love the most is now I don‚Äôt need to type the Alexa speaker has made it so easy for me ‚Ä¶..I think everyone who doesn‚Äôt have OTT on their TV but have an HDMI port should go for it !
"This is a must have for every home this time, got an amazing deal during the sale and is worth every pennyStreaming quality is good and the remote has volume control buttons to avoid TV remoteQuick launch buttons for Amazon Prime and Netflix are useful"
This is a great product. I just love and purchasing Amazon prime is a great deal. Now it saves my dth 600+ bucks.I was really tired of my 5 yr old watching daily soaps and hindi water cartoons.Now I am really happy we watch only relatable stuff. Also it's saving our monthly rs 600 for dth recharge
"Awesome product! But only issue I want to raise is my TV volume is suppressed. Before using it I was listening on volume 10-15 with Chromecast but now I have to volume up - up to 55-75, out of 100.Don't know the reason but hopefully amazon should work on it."
"Unbox self assemble,put batteries in remote. Turn on tvfire the stick.Update the stick to latest version.Signup or signin to your account.And say Alexa entertain me. Get latest trending movies show and more. This stick come with subscription in box. Just signup and avail benifit."
"Product is good but its extension cable is not good while connecting it blue screen error comes on the TV also so there is one more problem whenever we turn off TV and instrument fire stick, and then when we on the TV and firestick it did not connect to the internet every time I have to forgot the password of Wi-Fi and reconnect with new password then only it connect to the internet every time I have to add password although I have save the password in Amazon these two mistakes are there in this instrumentPlease solve these two problems or otherwise I have to return the instrument in sometime I will try if I did not get good satisfaction result I will return the product so I request the management team to undertake this problem and resolve it as early as possible"
I bought it to convert my tv to smart tv and to play all kinds of movies on usb to tv. So it has served both purposes so far i use my phone hotspot when i use firestick not wi fi all the time
Everything is amazing. On point. Has all the apps. I think the only missing feature is that we can't mirror screen. Also we can't connect directly from our phone to the TV for all apps except Amazon apps. I think that's a draw back. If that's not an issue I think u must buy this.
Product is so nice love it . Tq to amazon  seller  Tq a lot . Amzon but not supporting Jio TV  and in mirroring Jio cinema also not working.  Please improve these apps also just advise of mine  anyway Tq to amazon slot for this stick because my normal led convrted to smart Tq to amazon
"I am writing this review after using the product for 7-8 days. Streaming quality and Alexa integration are amazing though voice recognition is not that well. Also, no bundled OTT platform connection was provided along with the product. Overall, it is a nice product, if Amazon would have provided some free bundled packages with this product it would have better value for money."
"This was my first smart tv converter must say it's worth the money. Till now no issues very happy with my purchase, was in doubt before but all you need to know is if you have HDMI port in your tv and good wifi or data option  it's definitely gonna work. Just  need to subscribe your desired app whichever you like YouTube can be downloaded without any charges."
My father trained Alexa to show tamil bhajans on Youtube in his Tamilian english accent. He was so impressed by the voice commands that he loves technology. All his life he spent cursing the updates in Microsoft word. I am glad he loves it !
Everything was very good in this stick. The only dissapointment in this stick was that there was no playstore available. I jope the team shoild introduce this feature asap. A must-buy for expensive non-smart TVs.
"I'm using this product since 1month and I'm happy I bought it, especially fire stick. Fire stick can upgrade old led TV to latest one most of things.I highly recommend someone who does not want to change his 3-4 year old TV but as we all know our market is changing rapidly and if someone not want to spend 30k then just go for it."
"Excellent. Using on Samsung tv full hd 2014 make. Only few apps were in tv. But Fire TV stick has made my TV full fledged updated Streaming TV with all apps. I am using Prime Video, Amazon Music Hotstar and Jio Cinema subscribed apps. Enjoying. Thanks to Amazon. No need to change my tv."
"All good with this. Easy to install, easy to navigate between apps, great sound quality.I got it for 2199 during the great Indian shopping festival of 2021 and I was happy that it was a great deal but the price was same after the festival ended."
I am using fire TV stick from last 2 year ..In one word fire TV stick is best..I upgrade just because of remote and Good offer had so I ordered .But previously device and this device is same ..so if you not like me I mean always want new think then not to upgrade else go for it
"Wonderful Experience..1. Quality of Streaming..2. Voice Recognition by Alexa is ultimate3. Remote is Quite Sturdy and easy to operateAfter having experienced it, I have purchased one more in a span of 15 days.."
Despite few flaws in Alexa ans voice recognition my purpose for live streaming has met so am happy overall.Packing was good with an user manual to setup.Cost of buying online makes huge differences buying the same product in outlets.
I was using ChromeCast for my TV and I purchased a new TV for my parents with Fire TV Stick.The Remote in FireTV Stick is awesome and it is very user friendly for my parents to watch Hotstar and other contents.The Alexa voice recognition is super and I have not expected it will be super usefull.The only problem I am facing is that I can able to cast youtube video from mobile but not from hotstar or other apps.
"Fire TV stick is an overall device I wanted to enjoy live streaming from news to sports to entertainment, etc. Recommended to all who does note have a smart TV. Also it's portability in nature is really easy to use and can be accessed everywhere."
Good. But all live tv channel not connected in live tv option. Live tv channel of Disney hotstar app not connected till date. Zee Bangla HD channel and many channel  also not connected till date. Hope all channel to be included in live tv channel as earliest.
I really liked this device and this has made viewing Web content much easier. Also the pain of typing wifi passwords etc. is gone with smart configuration options - love that feature.The only thing I could have hoped for was that the next key on remote took me to the next video on youtube - for me it doesn't happen.
"I'm using this on a VU TV, the Picture clarity and the Sound Output is awesome when using the Firestick.It has quiet a lot of regional channels too, apart from amazon prime, disney hotstar, netflix... The Voice recognition is also working great. You should get a firestick to know the difference..."
Fire stick to convert your TV to high performance smart entertainment system. The connectivity and app integration is real fluid. And with the pricing its economical too. Go for it if you want to convert a not so smart TV to fully loaded smart TV.
I have no clue why it took me this long to buy this. I have completely stopped watching OTT contents on my computer. It's fast. Loads movies quickly. The only con would be the price. But I got a good deal on Great Indian Sale
Best devise for watching tv smartly. Easy to install. Its remote have shortcut keys for various sites. It needs small extention box. Highly Recommended for those who have high  speed unlimited data pack.
Super streaming quality..thank god my device remote paired within single time with firestick nd my lg led 2014 modal t.v. I m afraid before buying this after reading many reviews about remote pairing prob. Finally i complete all settings nd update latest version.There are lot of offer at sale time i have got 3 mnth free Amazon prime membership with firestick. Sach a beautiful device with great build quality thanks to Amazon...
"Excellent product, last year I bought one android box, wasted my money, instead I could have gone for this, almost all the app can be downloaded, streaming is nice, and mirroring is also very good, it would be more better if added vi movie app also"
"Got it on offer for the price of 2399..Picture clarity is awesome and the dedicated buttons for apps are a huge advantage. Installation and update went smoothly.Working perfectly with my non android 55"" VU tv."
This is amazing!! Made my TV better than smart tv.Pros:- Works smoothly and has no lag after the start.- Remote is of good quality and has Alexa support- Voice search with remote is really convenient and every member of my family loves it.- Stream quality is really good and even better than my Samsung smart TV.Cons:- fewer customization options
"I am really impressed with this device. It has converted my non-Smart TV into Smart TV. I face no lag issues (lag is larger on my another Smart TV), and the performance is seamless. Bought this for my parents' TV and they are delighted."

"It works nicely. When I talk to it it amegietly does what I tell it to do for example: Alexa,play classical music. You don't really need to say Alexa but you can if you want to. The blue button is the Alexa button you have to keep that button pressed and then talk to it."
Support Fire tv stick upgrade by  exchanging old devices with new gen fire sticks in future. Most of the people stuck with old fire sticks. Just a suggestion üòâ

"This is my second fire tv stick..I am happy with the 2nd generation stick , so got the new 3rd generation for my new tv and it works like charm. The new features makes it more cool."
"I'm using both Amazon Fire Stick & MI TV Stick on the two TVs separatly in my home... And after comparing both,  I will say that the Amazon Fire stick is better than MI TV stick....Because , Amazon fire stick have Alexa that have more functionalities than Google Assistant.. The great customer care services ..and  Value for money... I really impressed by its features.... I thing You should also buy it...."
"Hi there, its been 7-8 days since my using of the fire tv stick 3rd gen.You have to buy this because it does not cost any subscription to use this and saves rs. 400 per month if the cable it only needs wifi to stream1. It provides you free movies, tv shows,  plus YouTube and some games that too smooth and etc .Too good just go for it it converts ur tv to a smart tv ......"
"Fire TV stick works seamlessly. Good build quality. User friendly though it took a while for initial setup. Dolby atmos software does enhance the sound.More than that I must commend the customer care from Amazon, I had received a faulty product at first. Not just they replaced it with a new one, they rewarded me a cash voucher for the inconvenience suffered."
Its a good device.Pros: streaming is niceNo laggingEasy to installCons: doesn't support my samsung 780 p tv but support my lg tv 1080p full hdVolume buttons didn't work even after a lot of efforts.Overall a good product to convert normal full hd tv into smart tv
It have some connectivity issue ansd it also not recognize voice properly. This product at this arte not worth.
"Not secure Amazon fire stick tv koi bhi device YouTube ke jariye firestick TV se Jude ja raha hai aur jo hum  channel Dekh Rahe Hain vah cut Ho Kar YouTube khul ja raha hai bena kesi code ke koi vhi device cannot ho ja raha hai iss problem ko thik karna hoga nahi too koi vhi device cannot kar YouTube ke jariye firestick TV se connect ho kar kuch galat video on kar sakta hai, bhut big problem hai"
Does what its supposed to do with high quality and ver minimalistic user friendly user interface. The remote control is awesome and integrated Alexa works just fine.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I am using Fire Stick with benq computer external monitor with speakers working perfectly,Playing YouTube at 1080, hd in prime, i had converted my monitor to mini size monitor"
"Super,mind blowingJust hatsoff to the creativityMade my day"
"I don‚Äôt have words to describe how amazing this fire stick is! Top notch quality streaming, great collection of 100‚Äôs of cool apps. Value for money!Amazon simply makes amazing simple to use products which offer so much!!Wishing my Amazon family a very HAPPY & PROSPEROUS DIWALI !!"
"Everything is good. Setup done very easy, but unhappy with one Thing, My Itel tv cant startup TV control, as it its name not mention in Firestick 3rd Gen(2021)üò¢. I request Amazon to please Add Itel Tv in further update..For better experience i bought this, As i was Already had Firestick lite. So this one TV controls Matters i was nervous üòì."
This is my second FireTV stick. Running very good. The remote on this one is advanced than the previous one. Very nice and easy to carry while traveling.
Bought after several nudging from my 11 year old hastily. It works really well. I'm happy that it doesn't contain spoiler channels in default such as NETFLIX... We're happy n spoiled!
The material I received is quite good but it may not be suitable for my TV. During use I am not able to get the product of TV (Both Picture and Sound)
This is best fire stick compared all previous one. GUI is itself different and Remote operation are very clear. Also it‚Äôs fast. Definitely go for it.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I had ordered 2 firestick out of that 1 is working properly and another also get started but voice is not coming at allSo humble request to replace it and send me another 1 on its place"
If you have a old hdtv which is not smart tv or supports any app . This is the best option for you all . Like i have an old HDTV and a smart tv also but this device literally turn my old HDTV into a smart tv .Good productEasy to installAll you need is a good wifi and some subscriptions.Overall it's a good buy ‚ù§Ô∏è
Really liked it bcz i also used other brand's tv streaming stick but from all over it is best from all way. Recommended all to buy this who want to buy streaming stick
i was using MI 4k box but switched to amazon fire stock ..believe me it is best and picture quality is amazing..thanks amazon
Please read if you are confuse between this and mi tv stick(not mi tv box). If you are buying these devices for streaming then firestick beats mi in every aspect. Only drawbacks are absence of playstore and Chromecast. Overall this one is better among all streaming devices in present indian market.
"One of the best available in the whole country. I would personally recommend it for those who does not own a android/smart tv. Go for it. Worth for every penny,Amazon really did a great job."
Streaming quality is good but really that depends on the internet speed as well. Alexa needs to get a little accurate in her response. Overall its value for money and it's an awesome product that can enhance your TV viewing experience üëå
"Works well. Unlike the older generation, which used to lose frames and even shut down due to overheating, this one handles mirroring flawlessly."
"The device was working fine. Though it was a little hot after hours of usage, other then that it's great for streaming. Picture and sound quality was superb. I m happy with this product."
Product is good I transformed my normal micromax led in fully smart tv. Experience is great but boli key is not working for me in even this 3rd generation stick.
"It was working good during the first few days it arrived. But it has not been a month and the stick has started lagging. Right now it is not even working, I turned it on and there is nothing, nothing at all on the screen, it has been more than 10min and the screen is still blank. I bought this with high expectations. I am very disappointed."
"It is overall a great product , it enhances both the display and audio quality along with providing voice search featureThe only drawback I would say is you cannot use the voice feature to type in any apps.But still it would be a great upgrade to your Monitor or old TV"
"very good streaming device, swift fast ui and good user experiance but lacking simple process in screencast and support for usb when compared to android tv box"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I love this Amazon fire tv stick it‚Äôs a wonderful product. Really value for money"
The stream and picture quality is very good.Very easy setup. The sound is clear with Dolby Atmos. The remote is working with the batteries given. The TV is turning on and off when the power button is pressed on the firestick remote.
It‚Äôs a nice product for a semi smart or non smart tv. It‚Äôs just lack one thing and that is jio tv. If that will be added then you can say goodbye to d2h
Awesome Experiencing in the new world of entertainment!!

"Excellent product , excellent streaming quality , those who have smart tv (not android tv) should also buy the product because smart TV's don't have hotstar app, jio cinema , mxplayer , etc . User interface is also very smooth nd mindblowing picture quality , I m very satisfied after using fire tv stick"
"fire tv stick lite received, instead of fire tv stick 3rd generation 2021, product already preused,Made complain to customer care , Correct item was send the very next day.Thanks for the prompt response  .Excellent streaming quality , easy to integrate with existing Tv"
easy to set up... streams in full HD..... reasonable price after discount ....  so far so good.....lets see how durable it is... will update

The video and sound quality is excellent. Can switch off/on TV and Controll volume. Alexa is very good
Dont buy expensive samrt tv... Buy normal tv and use fire stick tv this is the best ever thing Thanks amazon for giving this productüëçüòä
"This is a good product which helps convert your basic TV to smart TV, even allows you to install apps,, etc. However it would have been great if there was a built-in Chromecast like MI TV stick.‚Äù"
Earlier I tried with other devices but this one is awesome. Instant connection. Just plug n Play. Got @1999/- plus 3 months free prime subscription during Big Billion Days.
"Very good product as explained , but cannot replaced Cable TV or DTH service. Limit Live programs."
"A friend of mine recommend me this device because my telivision is not smart TV and this fire TV stick got synced with it so good and now I'm able to watch everything on my tv what I couldn't before like Amazon prime or Netflix and youtube, it's so good. I'm really satisfied with it."
I was Unable to configure Amazon fire stick and remote..Had placed request to return the product. received a call from Amazon team who guided me through the Configuration of Fire TV. Replaced the Order and was the easiest one to configure.
"This is awesome 4.5 stars for the product but they could make the playstore support , well you can see cinemas and stuff what an android tv is built for, worth it, for timepass you can play reteo games too with your controller, this acts like a mini android console. Other words: Cheap playstation.."
Bought this as the remote of old fire tv stick was damaged and just the remote costs 2k !!! Good improvement. Really liked the volume control buttons.
"Waited for it to come on sale, definitely worth paying for, and technically it's all you need.we dont regret buying it."
Working as expected. Now I am enjoying all apps in one device with high resolution.
"The product works quite smoothly. Very compatible to all types of accent and set up is very easy. Product comes with a small help to initiate the set up. Overall good streaming. If you want to experience steaming on your tv, go for it! Good product."
Gives good environment for entertainment and full of knowledge videos for my daughter now no need of any dish
"It's a very good, I like the new remort with Alexa voice it's a fast and new interface."
Got this firestick & alexa remote on the Great Indian festival fr 2199/- & its worth evry penny. Easy to configure & stream quality is amazing. Made my tv premium!
Sound and Picture quality is superb.!!!. You will like to watch movies  once you connect this deviceüëç
Don't listen to haters saying that this is a bad product. Had a seven year old tv and now it's a smart tv.Voice recognition is great.Good response time.Easy to install.
Good alternative to your local cable wala who charges exorbitant charges at installation and subsequent monthly subscription.However you will have to subscribe to OTT platforms for viewing programs of your choice.Turns your normal TV to smart TV.
Absolutely lightning fast compared to my 1st gen stick which felt as dying after 3 years of use.
Streaming is wonderful with HD quality. My TV is 32 inch with FULL HD support and the video streaming is super good. Yet to watch movie from OTT but saw  LIVE sports and the experience is GOOD
This device has features that even my Sony Led tv could not give.. i am flaunted by the features.. my tv has become more than just smart tv. Happy with the product. Once you take this device you dont hv to buy anything else.
Overall product was good and price also good.But unfortunately remote control is not suits with my TV. Returned back the product.Amazon customer care is really supportive (24x7)
I have given 4 star out of 5 as I am having Onida Tv (Android TV) 2017 edition for which volume and power off option is not getting set. Other wise excellent product.
Excellent product. Great built quality. Apps works faster and load times are minimal. Great UI
Good in all ways except sound quality when tv is connected to soundbar is inferior to th earlier model.
"If faster, and works more easily.Good for non smart TV with HDMI port."
"The product is good, but i have a problem in wifi connectivity in fire stick. It wont connect at a first go. Every time have to switch off modem and then reconnect. Remote is also not working in my tv. Except these the stream quality and speed is nice in Amazon fire stick."
Very Happy with the product. Superb streaming with just my mobile data. Got it at 1880 + 3 months prime membership - best offer of the season.
Best streaming device though the quality of remote is not up to the mark.
the trouble free easy watching on TV in the comfort of my room... relaxing and great...
I brought this product mainly for casting from Android mobile. Works perfectly. Value for money.
"I've been using Chromecast for streaming digital content for past 5-6 years, until when my friend recommended using üî• stick.Bought this device a couple of weeks back and I'm glad to make this decision. Bought for 2k during Diwali offer."
Excellent Quality built and Viewing experience is awesome. Software performance fluent No lag super performance.

Easy setup and very good video quality. When discount I will purchase 10 pieces.
"Excellent purchase, fast streaming, integrated with alexa. Excellent purchase"

Amazon app store give limited application.Need more application like Play Store or need more improvement for look like android tv.

"Awesome. now I am enjoying watching my TV, Thanks to this fire stick. works perfect"
Had the first gen before and knew I had to upgrade. Well worth it. Disconnected all cable tv and have been only streaming. One of the best products to date when it comes to value for money
Cable TV is outdated. OTT is future. Amazon Fire Stick is beyond exceptional
"The stick is working properly.. the remote's power, mute & volume up/down button will control the tv actually.. just fyi."
Very nice and more valuable product..
"If you have older version of tv and want it use it like smart tv. Go for Amazon firetv stick. Multiple apps available, ultimate streaming quality and worth every penny"

It is worth the money and satisfies the purpose it meant for.  We are yet to have full use Alexa. But good.

Nice Product. Compatible with my Devices.. Now my TV is Smart Tv.
Working very smooth and streaming quality is really good my family like this product.

Got this for 2399 in sale. It's good product to make your old led tv a smart tv. Better to buy this instead of buying a smart tv.
It streams much faster than 2 nd generation fire stick.
This device is perfect for streaming and youtube or all other kinds of apps. Got it for only 2200 during the sale.
Wonderful stream quality and alexa integration!
Fire Tv is much better and easier to use than android TV. Android Tv is a bit slow sometimes but fire Tv is fast.
